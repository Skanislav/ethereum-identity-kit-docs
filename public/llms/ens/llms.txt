# docs.ens.domains llms.txt

> The Ethereum Name Service (ENS) is a distributed, open, and extensible naming system based on the Ethereum blockchain. ENS maps human-readable names like 'alice.eth' to machine-readable identifiers such as Ethereum addresses, other cryptocurrency addresses, content hashes, metadata, and more. 

## General

- [faq](https://docs.ens.domains/faq): Frequently Asked Questions about the Ethereum Name Service
- [dweb-intro](https://docs.ens.domains/dweb/intro): The ContentHash is a very popular component of an ENS name, first introduced in [ENSIP-7](/ensip/7).
- [ensip-index](https://docs.ens.domains/ensip/index): This page contains a summary of all the ENS Improvement Proposals (ENSIPs) that have been proposed, and their current status.
- [bugs](https://docs.ens.domains/bugs): The ENS bug bounty program rewards anyone who finds a bug in covered ENS smart contracts and ENS Labs assets.

- [dns-tlds](https://docs.ens.domains/dns/tlds): Alongside the `.eth` Top Level Domain, the ENS Protocol also supports most of your favourite DNS Top Level Domains (such as `.com`, `.cash` or `.domains`).
- [changelog](https://docs.ens.domains/changelog): This page contains a list of changes and events that happened to the ENS protocol & ecosystem.

## Registry

- [registry-reverse](https://docs.ens.domains/registry/reverse): Reverse resolution in ENS - the process of mapping from an Ethereum address (eg, 0x1234.
- [registry-dns](https://docs.ens.domains/registry/dns): Registrar responsible for all DNSSEC enabled names
- [registry-eth](https://docs.ens.domains/registry/eth): The ETH Registrar is a special registrar.
- [registry-ens](https://docs.ens.domains/registry/ens): The ENS registry is the core contract that lies at the heart of ENS resolution.

## Wrapper

- [wrapper-creating-subname-registrar](https://docs.ens.domains/wrapper/creating-subname-registrar): In the [Use Cases](/wrapper/usecases#sell-or-rent-subnames) section, we talked about the ability to stand up your own "registrar" to allow other people to register/claim subnames automatically.
- [wrapper-fuses](https://docs.ens.domains/wrapper/fuses): A "fuse" is a permission or perk that can be granted/revoked on a name.
- [wrapper-expiry](https://docs.ens.domains/wrapper/expiry): In order to burn any fuses on a name, you must also set an **expiry** on it.
- [wrapper-usecases](https://docs.ens.domains/wrapper/usecases): By default, newly registered names will use the Public Resolver, which just allows the current manager/controller of the name to update any records.
- [wrapper-contracts](https://docs.ens.domains/wrapper/contracts): The Name Wrapper contract is deployed on these chains:
- [wrapper-states](https://docs.ens.domains/wrapper/states): Wrapper States
