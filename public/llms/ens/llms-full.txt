# docs.ens.domains llms.txt

> The Ethereum Name Service (ENS) is a distributed, open, and extensible naming system based on the Ethereum blockchain. ENS maps human-readable names like 'alice.eth' to machine-readable identifiers such as Ethereum addresses, other cryptocurrency addresses, content hashes, metadata, and more. 

# Reverse Registrar [Registrar responsible for Primary Names]

Reverse resolution in ENS - the process of mapping from an Ethereum address (eg, 0x1234...) to an ENS name - is handled using a special namespace, .addr.reverse. A special-purpose registrar controls this namespace and allocates subdomains to any caller based on their address. The reverse registrar is specified in EIP 181.

For example, the account `0x314159265dd8dbb310642f98f50c066173c1259b` can claim `314159265dd8dbb310642f98f50c066173c1259b.addr.reverse`.
After doing so, it can configure a resolver and expose metadata, such as a canonical ENS name for this address.

The reverse registrar provides functions to `claim` a reverse record,
as well as a convenience function (`setName`) to configure the record as it's most commonly used, as a way of specifying a canonical name for an address.

## Lookup Primary Name

If you are interested in [querying the primary name for an address](/web/reverse) you can checkout the web section.

## Set Primary Name

```solidity
function setName(string memory name) public returns (bytes32)
```

Configures the caller's reverse ENS record to point to the provided `name`.

This convenience function streamlines the process of setting up a reverse record for the common case where a user only wants to configure a reverse name and nothing else. It performs the following steps:

1. Sets the reverse record for the caller to be owned by the ReverseRegistrar.
2. Sets the reverse record for the caller to have `defaultResolver` as its resolver.
3. Sets the `name()` field in the `defaultResolver` for the caller's reverse record to `name`.

In short, after calling this, a user has a fully configured reverse record claiming the provided name as that account's canonical name.

Users wanting more flexibility will need to use `claim` or `claimWithResolver` and configure records manually on their chosen resolver contract.

## Multichain Considerations

The current infrastructure for primary names across multiple chains is being worked on.

## Other Functions

### Claim Address

```solidity
function claim(address owner) public returns (bytes32);
```

Claims the caller's address in the reverse registrar, assigning ownership of the reverse record to `owner`. Equivalent to calling `claimWithResolver(owner, 0)`.

```solidity
function claimWithResolver(address owner, address resolver) public returns (bytes32)
```

Claims the caller's address in the reverse registrar, assigning `ownership` of the reverse record to owner. If `resolver` is nonzero, also updates the record's resolver.

After calling this function:

- The reverse record for the caller (1234....addr.reverse) is owned by `owner`.
- If `resolver` is nonzero, the reverse record for the caller has its resolver set to `resolver`; otherwise it is left unchanged.

### Get Default Resolver

```solidity
Resolver public defaultResolver;
```

Returns the address of the resolver contract that the `ReverseRegistrar` uses for `setName`.

# DNS Registrar

In [DNS on ENS](/learn/dns) we learned how ENS aims to extend the functionality of the DNS.
On this page we will explore the implementation of DNSSEC, the DNSRegistrar, and the building blocks for gasless DNSSEC.

:::note
Not all top level domains support DNSSEC, and some might have custom ENS
implementations. Please refer to the [TLD List](/dns/tlds) for TLD-specific
information.
:::

## DNSSEC

DNSSEC (Domain Name System Security Extensions) is an added layer of security on top of DNS that allows for cryptographic verification of records. It establishes a chain of trust from the root key (which is signed by ICANN) down to each key.

All ENS-enabled DNS names are required to use DNSSEC, and the [DNSSECOracle](https://github.com/ensdomains/ens-contracts/tree/master/contracts/dnssec-oracle) is responsible for verifying the signatures.

### Claiming a Name Onchain

Since 2021, it has been possible to [import a DNS name](/learn/dns#importing-a-dns-name) and use that as an ENS name. This process involves enabling DNSSEC, setting a specific TXT record, and submitting a proof to the [DNSRegistrar](https://github.com/ensdomains/ens-contracts/tree/master/contracts/dnsregistrar) smart contract.

Expect your `TXT` record to look something like this:

```
TXT @ _ens a=&lt;eth-address&gt;
```

You can learn more about [how to import a DNS name](/learn/dns#importing-a-dns-name) in the DNS section, or see how to [programmatically complete these steps](#programming-dnssec-proofs).

There is no ENS protocol fee to import a DNS name, but it requires a large amount of gas (up to a few million) to submit the proof onchain. Continue reading to learn how this has been mitigated.

## Offchain Verification (Gasless)

[EP 5.1](/dao/proposals/5.1) introduced a new DNSSECOracle and DNSRegistrar which makes it possible to perform DNSSEC verification at query time, enabling truly free usage of DNS names in ENS. We call this "gasless DNSSEC".

It works by enabling [wildcard resolution](/ensip/10) at the DNS TLD level. During the [name resolution process](/resolution), if a name doesn't already exist onchain but has been configured for usage in ENS, the DNSSEC proof will be fetched offchain via [CCIP Read](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3668) and then verified onchain with the same DNSSECOracle mentioned above.

### Import a DNS name gaslessly

To configure a DNS name for usage in ENS, simply add a `TXT` record with the following format:

```
TXT @ ENS1 &lt;resolver-address&gt;
```

The `resolver-address` implementation is customizable just like any other ENS resolver. To get started quickly, a special ExtendedDNSResolver has been deployed which allows users to specify an ETH address that the name should resolve to within the same `TXT` record. To use this setup, simply add a record with the following format:

```
TXT @ ENS1 &lt;extended-resolver-address&gt; &lt;eth-address&gt;
TXT @ ENS1 0x238A8F792dFA6033814B18618aD4100654aeef01 0x225f137127d9067788314bc7fcc1f36746a3c3B5
```

## Other

### TLD Ownership

You can lookup the `owner` of any TLD by calling the `Registry.owner(bytes32 node)` function.
If at least one domain has been imported for this TLD (via the onchain method), the owner will be either the `DNSRegistrar` or a smart contract controlled by the respective registry operator.

If a TLD has not yet been activated, the `owner` will return `0x0` and it may require one user to import a name onchain to activate the TLD. See the [supported TLD list](/dns/tlds) for more info.

### Programming DNSSEC Proofs

To help you interact with DNSSEC data and the DNSRegistrar, we provide a few libraries.

- [DNSProvejs](https://github.com/ensdomains/dnsprovejs) = A library for querying and validating DNSSEC data from DNS
- [ENSjs](https://github.com/ensdomains/ensjs) = A library for interacting with ENS smart contracts

#### Retrieving a proof

```ts
import { addEnsContracts } from '@ensdomains/ensjs'
import { getDnsImportData } from '@ensdomains/ensjs/dns'
import { createPublicClient, http } from 'viem'
import { mainnet } from 'viem/chains'

const client = createPublicClient({
  chain: addEnsContracts(mainnet),
  transport: http(),
})

const dnsImportData = await getDnsImportData(client, {
  name: 'example.com',
})
```

#### Submitting the proof to the DNSRegistrar

```ts
import { addEnsContracts } from '@ensdomains/ensjs'
import { getDnsImportData, importDnsName } from '@ensdomains/ensjs/dns'
import { createPublicClient, createWalletClient, custom, http } from 'viem'
import { mainnet } from 'viem/chains'

const mainnetWithEns = addEnsContracts(mainnet)

const client = createPublicClient({
  chain: mainnetWithEns,
  transport: http(),
})

const wallet = createWalletClient({
  chain: mainnetWithEns,
  transport: custom(window.ethereum),
})

const dnsImportData = await getDnsImportData(client, {
  name: 'example.com',
})

await importDnsName(wallet, {
  name: 'example.com',
  dnsImportData,
})
```

## Other functions

```ts
// Get the list of suffixes
DNSRegistrar.suffixes
// Get Oracle
DNSRegistrar.oracle
```

```ts
DNSRegistrar.claim(bytes name, bytes proof)
DNSRegistrar.proveAndClaim(bytes name, tuple[] input, bytes proof)
DNSRegistrar.proveAndClaimWithResolver(bytes name, tuple[] input, bytes proof, address resolver, address addr)
```

# ETH Registrar [Smart contracts responsible for the ".eth" TLD]

The ETH Registrar is a special registrar. It allows for trustless on-chain name registration and is in charge of the ".eth" TLD.

## BaseRegistrar vs Controller

The ETH Registrar is split into two contracts. The [BaseRegistrar](https://github.com/ensdomains/ens-contracts/blob/staging/contracts/ethregistrar/BaseRegistrarImplementation.sol) and the [ETHRegistrarController](https://github.com/ensdomains/ens-contracts/blob/staging/contracts/ethregistrar/ETHRegistrarController.sol).

The BaseRegistrar is responsible for name ownership, transfers, etc (ownership related), while the Controller is responsible for registration & renewal (pricing related). This separation is done to reduce the attack surface of the registrar, and provides users with the guarantees of continued ownership of a name so long as the registrar is in place.

### Controllers

The [ETHRegistrarController](https://github.com/ensdomains/ens-contracts/blob/staging/contracts/ethregistrar/ETHRegistrarController.sol) is the main controller for the ETH Registrar, and provides a straightforward registration and renewal mechanism.

## Pricing Structure

The ETH Registrar charges a fee for registration.
This fee is paid in ETH and is set to prevent spamming the registrar.
Any protocol fees are sent to the ENS Treasury.

### Pricing Oracle

Initially, a single pricing oracle was deployed, the [StablePriceOracle](https://github.com/ensdomains/ens-contracts/blob/master/contracts/ethregistrar/StablePriceOracle.sol).
This contract has owner-set prices for each name length (1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or more).
Users do not have to interact with this oracle directly, as the controller provides functionality to determine the pricing for a registration or renewal.

### 3, 4, and 5 Letter Names

The ETH Registrar has special pricing for 3, 4, and 5 (and more) letter names. At the time of writing, a `5+` letter `.eth` will cost you `5 USD` per year.
A `4` letter `160 USD` per year, and a `3` letter `640 USD` per year.
This pricing structure is done to promote market diversity as there are an exponentially less amount of names the shorter they become.
The minimum length of a name is 3 characters.

| Name Length | Price (USD) |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| 5+          | 5           |
| 4           | 160         |
| 3           | 640         |

### Premium & Auctions

In addition to length-based pricing the ETH Registrar also has a premium pricing structure.
90 days after a name expires (aka after the grace period), the name will go into a Temporary Premium Auction.
The Auction is a 21 day dutch auction, meaning that the price starts high (~100 Million USD) and exponentially decrease till it hits 0 or a bid goes through.

This is done to prevent sniping of names, and ensures the name goes to the highest bidder fairly.

<Card>
  <div className="mx-auto h-32">
    <svg className="h-full w-full" width="160" height="90" viewBox="0 0 160 90">
      <path d="M 10 10 Q 10 80 150 80" stroke="#3889FF" fill="transparent" />
    </svg>
  </div>
</Card>

You can read more about the temporary premium in [this article](https://support.ens.domains/en/articles/7900612-temporary-premium).

### Where does the money go?

Upon registration funds are sent to the ETHRegistrarController. The controller then sends the funds to the ENS Treasury (anyone can call the `withdraw` method to trigger this).
Income from the ETH Registrar is used to fund the development of ENS, its ecosystem, and other public goods.

Read more about our spending in [Article III of the Constitution](/dao/constitution#iii-income-funds-ens-and-other-public-goods).

## ERC721 and NFTs

In the early days of ENS, the ERC721 standard did not exist.
The original ETH Registrar formed the pre-cursor to the ERC721 standard.
As we witnessed the ERC721 being standardized, support for it was added to the ETH Registrar.

Today, users can interact with the ETH Registrar to transfer their name just like with any other ERC721 token.

## Registering a Name

Registering a name is a trustless process that takes place onchain (more on this below). Some open source frontends for registering names are the [ENS Manager App](https://app.ens.domains/), [ENS Fairy](https://ensfairy.xyz/), Rainbow Wallet.

The process of registering a `.eth` name uses a commit-reveal process.

<Card className="flex items-center justify-center gap-8">
  <div className="flex flex-col items-center text-center">
    <FiHash className="text-2xl" />
    <span>Commit</span>
  </div>
  <div className="flex flex-col items-center text-center">
    <FiClock className="text-2xl" />
    <span>Wait</span>
  </div>
  <div className="flex flex-col items-center text-center">
    <FiBookOpen className="text-2xl" />
    <span>Reveal</span>
  </div>
</Card>

### Commit-Reveal

The ETHRegistrarController, the highest level contract that users register names through, implements a commit reveal scheme to prevent frontrunning registrations.

We first call the `commit` function with an opaque bit of data (the `commitmenthash`), wait 60 seconds, and then call the `register` function. The `commit` function takes a commitment hash, which can be generated using the `makeCommitment` function. The commitment hash is opaque and revealed during the `register` function.

The commit-reveal process is to prevent a malicious actor from seeing your `register` transaction in the public mempool and frontrunning it.

```solidity
ETHRegistrarController.makeCommitment(
    name string,
    owner address,
    duration uint256,
    secret bytes32,
    resolver address,
    data bytes[],
    reverseRecord bool,
    ownerControlledFuses uint16
)

// For example
makeCommitment(
    "myname", // "myname.eth" but only the label
    0x1234..., // The address you want to own the name
    31536000, // 1 year (in seconds)
    0x1234..., // A randomly generated 32 byte secret you create
    0x1234..., // The address of the resolver you want to use
    [0x8b95dd71...], // Encoded function calls you want to pass to the resolver, like `setAddr()`
    false, // Whether or not to set the new name as your primary name
    0 // The NameWrapper fuses you want to set
);
```

Once you have calculated the commitment hash, submit the `commit` transaction.

```solidity
ETHRegistrarController.commit(commitment bytes32)
```

After having committed, it is required to wait at least the `MIN_COMMITMENT_AGE` (60 seconds) before making the subsequent `register` transaction.

### Registering

Once you have made the onchain commitment and waited 60 seconds, you can register your name.
Registration takes in the same parameters as the `makeCommitment` function above.

Before initiating registration, ensure that:

- `available(label)` == `true`, where `label` is "name" in "name.eth"
- `duration` >= `MIN_REGISTRATION_DURATION`
- `commitments[commitment]` is between 1 min and 24 hrs old
- `msg.value` >= `rentPrice(name, duration)` + `5-10% (slippage)`

Because the rent price is paid in ETH but denominated in USD, callers are recommended to send slightly more than the value returned by `rentPrice` to avoid issues with fast price changes. A premium of 3-5% will likely be sufficient.
Any excess funds sent during registration are automatically returned to the caller.

```solidity
ETHRegistrarController.register(
    name string,
    owner address,
    duration uint256,
    secret bytes32,
    resolver address,
    data bytes[],
    reverseRecord bool,
    ownerControlledFuses uint16
)

// For example
register(
    "myname", // "myname.eth" but only the label
    0x1234..., // The address you want to own the name
    31536000, // 1 year (in seconds)
    0x1234..., // The same secret you used in the `commit` transaction
    0x1234..., // The address of the resolver you want to use
    [0x8b95dd71...], // Encoded function calls you want to pass to the resolver, like `setAddr()`
    false, // Whether or not to set the new name as your primary name
    0 // The NameWrapper fuses you want to set
);
```

## Renewing a Name

```solidity
ETHRegistrarController.renew()
```

Any user can renew a domain, not just the owner. This means that if you want to ensure a name doesn't expire you can renew it for someone.

By allowing renewal for any arbitrary amount of time users can ensure their name will not expire.
As per the separation between registry and controller, even with upgraded controller your name will still be yours.

# The Registry [Root Registry of the Ethereum Name Service]

The ENS registry is the core contract that lies at the heart of ENS resolution. All ENS lookups start by querying the registry. The registry maintains a list of domains, recording the owner, resolver, and TTL for each, and allows the owner of a domain to make changes to that data.

The ENS registry is specified in [EIP 137](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-137).

## Why Registries?

Top-Level Domains (TLDs), like `.eth`, `.com`, and `.test`, are owned by smart contracts called <b>registrars</b>, which specify rules governing the allocation of their names.
Anyone may, by following the rules imposed by these registrar contracts, obtain ownership of a domain for their own use.

| TLD                 | Registrar Contract                     |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `[root]`            | [The Registry](/registry/ens)          |
| `.eth`              | [ETH Registry](/registry/eth)          |
| `.com`, `.xyz`, etc | [DNS Registrar](/registry/dns)         |
| `.addr.reverse`     | [Reverse Registrar](/registry/reverse) |

## Who owns the root Registry?

The [ENS Registry](https://etherscan.io/address/0x00000000000C2E074eC69A0dFb2997BA6C7d2e1e) is owned by the [ENS Root](https://etherscan.io/address/0xaB528d626EC275E3faD363fF1393A41F581c5897) which is owned by the [ENS DAO Wallet](https://etherscan.io/address/0xFe89cc7aBB2C4183683ab71653C4cdc9B02D44b7).
To verify this you can run the `owner` function on the registry & root contracts.

## Other Functions

```ts
// Get Owner
ENS.owner(bytes32 node) view returns (address)
// Get Resolver
ENS.resolver(bytes32 node) view returns (address)

# FAQ

## Which wallets and dApps support ENS?

ENS is supported by a wide range of wallets and dApps, some notable ones can be found on the [integrations page](https://ens.domains/).
This page is currently under construction however a link to add yourself will be put here soon.

## Can I hold my name with one address, and point it at the other?

Yes, you can hold your name with one address and point it at another.
Simply visit the [ENS Manager App](https://ens.app/) and update the appropriate address record (by chain) for your name to point to the address you wish.

## Once I own a name, can I create my own subdomains?

Yes. You can create whatever subdomains you wish and assign ownership of them to other people if you desire. You can even set up your own registrar for your domain.

Some resolvers might provide even more advanced features, read more [about Resolvers](/resolvers/quickstart).

## Can I change the address my name points to after I've bought it?

Yes, you can update the addresses and other resources pointed to by your name at any time.

To update your name checkout the [ENS Manager App](https://ens.app/).

## ETH Registration

### Why are names registered as hashes?

Hashes provide a fixed length identifier that can easily be passed around between contracts with fixed overhead and no issues passing around variable-length strings.

Read more about [labelhash, namehash, and encodings](/resolution/names).

### What characters are supported?

ENS names are generally encoded using UTS-46.
This means there is partial support for Unicode characters, including emoji.

However technically possible to register any name, names that are not valid UTS-46 will not be resolvable by most resolvers.
Therefore it is generally recommended for apps that implement registration to limit the characters that can be registered to ensure a smooth experience.

To read more about supported characters [name normalization](/resolution/names).

### What does it cost to register a .eth domain?

Currently, registration costs are set at the following prices:

- 5+ character .eth names: $5 in ETH per year.
- 4 character .eth names: $160 in ETH per year.
- 3 character .eth names: $640 in ETH per year.

3 and 4 character names have higher pricing to reflect the small number of these names available.

To read more about the pricing structure of .eth names [read more about pricing](/registry/eth)

### How long can I register a name for?

You can register a name for as long as you would like.
There is no maximum registration duration.

### What happens if I forget to renew my name?

If you forget to renew your name, it will be released back to the public pool of available names.
Luckily the expiration process has a 90 day grace period.
This means that once the name expires the original owner has 90 days to renew the name before it is released.
After the grace period, the name is released for registration by anyone with a temporary premium which decreases over a 21 days period.
The released name continues to resolve your ETH address until the new owner overwrites it.

### In what way could I lose access to my name?

The .eth registrar is built to ensure once issued, a name cannot be revoked or taken away from its owner.
Potential loss can occur if the owner loses access to their private key, or if the owner forgets to renew their name.

## Root Registry

### Who owns the ENS rootnode? What powers does it grant them?

The ENS rootnode is currently owned by the ENS DAO. It used to be owned by the ENS Multi-sig, a group of keyholders from different parts of the ecosystem, however as of [EP4.10](/dao/proposals/4.10) the ownership has been transferred to the ENS DAO.

Ownership of the rootnode grants the ability to do the following:

- Control allocation and replacement of TLDs other than .eth - this is required to implement DNSSEC integration.
- Enable and disable controllers for the .eth registrar, which affect registration and renewal policies for .eth names.
- Update the pricing for .eth names.
- Receive and manage registration revenue.

### Can I register a TLD of my own within ENS?

Yes and No, We consider ENS to be part of the 'global namespace' in co-existence with DNS, and it is our priority to not pollute the namespace.
ENS-specific TLDs are restricted to only '.eth' on Mainnet Ethereum, or .eth and .test on testnets.

By default ENS allows users to [import their DNS name](/learn/dns) through the use of the [DNS Registrar](/registry/dns).
Existing DNS TLDs can [reach out to us](mailto:info@ens.domains) to take control of their TLD.

## What are the differences between ENS and other naming services such as Namecoin or Handshake?

ENS complements and extends the usefulness of DNS with decentralised, trustworthy name resolution for web3 resources such as blockchain addresses and distributed content, while Namecoin and Handshake are efforts to replace all or part of DNS with a blockchain-based alternative.

## Governance Token

### Can I recover tokens accidentally sent to the wrong address?

The answer depends on the address the token was sent to. If you accidentally sent the token to the token.ensdao.eth address (0xC18360217D8F7Ab5e7c516566761Ea12Ce7F9D72) or the wallet.ensdao.eth address (0xFe89cc7aBB2C4183683ab71653C4cdc9B02D44b7) then the tokens might be recoverable. Contact the [Meta-governance working group](/dao/stewards/) at the [ENS Forum](https://discuss.ens.domains) and explain the situation. Tokens can only be sent back to the address they were sent from, so if it was sent from an exchange, contact your exchange support to make sure the address can receive tokens.

If the tokens were sent to the null address (0x000..) or an address with a typo, then the tokens are unrecoverable and there's nothing that anyone can do. If the tokens were sent to an exchange or a third party, then contact that third party for help.

# Hosting a Decentralized Website [Introduction to hosting a decentralized website using ENS]

## ContentHash

The ContentHash is a very popular component of an ENS name, first introduced in [ENSIP-7](/ensip/7).
It can be queried by hitting the [contenthash(bytes32)](/resolvers/interfaces#0xbc1c58d1) function on a name's resolver.
You can also [set the contenthash on a name](/resolvers/interfaces#0x304e6ade) if the resolver supports it.

  {['ipfs://qMhx...', 'bzz:/2477', 'ar://HGa8...'].map((tag) => (
    <Badge key={tag} variant="secondary">
      {tag}
    </Badge>
  ))}
</Card>

## Hosting & Pinning

When it comes to hosting your files there are many options to choose from.

<Card className="flex justify-center gap-4">
  {['IPFS / Filecoin', 'Swarm', 'Arweave'].map((tag) => (
    <Badge key={tag} variant="secondary">
      {tag}
    </Badge>
  ))}
</Card>

Popular options include [IPFS](https://ipfs.io), [Swarm](https://ethswarm.org), and [Arweave](https://arweave.org).
Depending on what option you go with your files are either permanently stored on a network,
or require to be actively stored on at least one machine, also known as "pinning".

### Deploy your sites

Several helpful tools and platforms exist that you can use to deploy your website to IPFS, Swarm, or Arweave.
Most notably [fleek](https://fleek.xyz), [Pinata](https://pinata.cloud), and [Blumen](https://blumen.stauro.dev/).
Helping you easily deploy your website to a decentralized storage network.

## Setting your ContentHash

If you are using the public resolver (the default for names registered using the ENS Manager App), you can set the contenthash directly from within the [ENS Manager App](https://app.ens.domains).

If you are using a custom resolver, or are writing your own resolver you will be able to have more fine grained control over the contenthash field.
See [ENSIP-7](/ensip/7) for more information on the contenthash field.

## Browser Support & Gateways

In the ideal world every browser supports decentralized websites out of the box.
If you are using [MetaMask](https://metamask.io) or [Brave Browser](https://brave.com) you can already access IPFS websites directly.
On non-conforming browsers you can use a gateway such as [eth.link](https://eth.link) or [eth.limo](https://eth.limo) to access your website.
You can test if your browser supports decentralized websites by visiting [ens.eth](https://ens.eth) or use a gateway via [ens.eth.link](https://ens.eth.link).

# Creating a Subname Registrar

In the [Use Cases](/wrapper/usecases#sell-or-rent-subnames) section, we talked about the ability to stand up your own "registrar" to allow other people to register/claim subnames automatically. Maybe you want to give wrapped subnames out for free, or maybe you want to charge for them. Maybe you want to apply specific rules to the subnames, such as only allowing alphanumeric names. All of this is possible, and this article will break down what you need to do. It's recommended to first read the [Use Cases](/wrapper/usecases#sell-or-rent-subnames) section to get an overview of the decisions you'll need to make.

## Prerequisites

This guide assumes that your parent name (such as `myname.eth`) is already wrapped. If you're not sure whether your name is wrapped, look at the More tab on the Manager app. If the name is unwrapped, it will say so, and it will show you a "Wrap Name" button.

If you want to issue [Emancipated](/wrapper/states#emancipated) subnames, or subnames with [any other fuses](/wrapper/fuses) burned, then your parent name must first be [Locked](/wrapper/states#locked). You can do this on the Permissions tab in the ENS manager app.

:::note
Locking your name (in other words revoking the permission to unwrap) is an **irreversible** change. After you lock the name, you will no longer be able to unwrap it. This is a security guarantee for the holders of all subnames. It ensures that the owner of the parent name cannot get around the security guarantees of the Name Wrapper.

Best to do this on a testnet (Sepolia/Holesky) name first, for development or testing purposes.
:::

## Creating and Deploying your Registrar Contract

In order to create a new subname, your contract should call either `setSubnodeOwner` or `setSubnodeRecord` on the [NameWrapper contract](/learn/deployments#deployments). Also pass in the fuses and expiry at the same time, as needed.

```solidity
NameWrapper.setSubnodeOwner(bytes32 parentNode, string label, address owner, uint32 fuses, uint64 expiry)

// For example
setSubnodeOwner(
    0x6cbc..., // The namehash of the parent node, e.g. "myname.eth"
    "sub", // The label of the subname to create
    0x1234..., // The address you want to be the owner of the new subname
    65536, // The fuse bits OR'd together, that you want to burn
    2021232060 // The expiry for the subname
)

NameWrapper.setSubnodeRecord(bytes32 parentNode, string label, address owner, address resolver, uint64 ttl, uint32 fuses, uint64 expiry)

// For example
setSubnodeRecord(
    0x6cbc..., // The namehash of the parent node, e.g. "myname.eth"
    "sub", // The label of the subname to create
    0x1234..., // The address you want to be the owner of the new subname
    0x5678..., // The address of the resolver to set for the new subname
    0, // The TTL to set for the new subname
    65536, // The fuse bits OR'd together, that you want to burn
    2021232060 // The expiry for the subname
)
```

Your public-facing registration function would typically take at _least_ the parent node (namehash) and subname label as inputs, such as:

```solidity
register(bytes32 parentNode, string calldata label)
```

Then under the hood, your contract will call `setSubnodeRecord` and fill in the rest of the parameters on behalf of the user:

- owner: Typically the caller account, `msg.sender`
- resolver: Typically the default public resolver, `resolver.eth`
- ttl: 0
- fuses: Up to you and your goals. See the [Use Cases](/wrapper/usecases#sell-or-rent-subnames) section for a discussion on this. Typically 65536 for an enamcipated rental subname, or 327680 for an emancipated "forever" name.
- expiry: Up to you and your goals. If you are renting subnames for a particular length of time, this expiry would reflect that. If you are allowing registration of "forever" names, then you can just set the expiry equal to the parent name's current expiry.

Of course, if you want to give the registrant more power/convenience, you could allow some of those parameters to be passed in to your public register function as well.

### Setting Resolver Records

If you want your subname registrar to set records on a subname in the same registration transaction, then the flow will be slightly different. In that case, perform these steps:

- Call `setSubnodeOwner`, setting the _contract itself_ (`address(this)`) as the owner of the subname, temporarily. This first step is needed for the default Public Resolver so that the contract has the authority to set records for the subname.
- Call whatever [resolver methods](/resolvers/interacting) you need to. Perhaps these are records that you want to be pre-set on your subnames (such as an ETH address that the subname points to). Or perhaps these are records that you allow the registrant to pass in, so that they can register their subname and set whatever records they want all in one transaction.
- Call `setSubnodeRecord`, but this time set the owner to the actual intended owner of the subname. This is the point at which you should set the appropriate fuses and expiry you want to, as well.

In addition, you will need to make sure your contract follows the [ERC-1155 Token Receiver rules](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1155#erc-1155-token-receiver). This means implementing the `onERC1155Received` and `onERC1155BatchReceived` methods, and signaling support for them in your ERC-165 `supportsInterface` method. OpenZeppelin has an easy abstract contract you can include for all this: [ERC1155Holder.sol](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC1155/utils/ERC1155Holder.sol)

### Taking fees

If you are setting up a "rental" registrar, then your registration function should require a certain amount of ETH to be sent in as well.

Alternatively, you could choose to allow users to spend ERC-20 tokens instead. To accomplish that, you would typically call the ERC-20 method `transferFrom` on the token contract. This also means that the registrant would first need to approve your contract as a spender for that token, meaning they would need to execute a separate approval transaction first (either to approve unlimited spending, or to approve the specific number of tokens needed to register the subname).

### Reference Implementation

Luckily, you don't need to start from scratch! The ENS Labs devs have created some example contracts you can start from:

https://github.com/ensdomains/ens-contracts/tree/feature/subdomain-registrar/contracts/subdomainregistrar

These contracts include two different implementations:

#### Forever Subname Registrar

This is a basic FIFS (First in first serve) registrar. The registration can take a fixed fee, or this fee can be set to 0 if you wish for subnames to be free. Names automatically are set to the parent's expiry can the fuse for `CAN_EXTEND_EXPIRY` will be burnt on registration so the user can extend their expiry if the parent also extends theirs. For a better UX, it is recommended that the parent sets their expiration as high as possible to allow their users to not have to think about renewing.

#### Rental Subname Registrar

This is a basic FIFS (First in first serve) registrar. The key difference between this and the ForeverSubdomainRegistrar is that it does not auto-burn the `CAN_EXTEND_EXPIRY` fuse and instead exposes a `renew()` function that allows paid renewal. This registrar also needs to be paired with a rental-based pricing contract. For simplicity, the deployer can deploy this pricing contract and the UI can pass this address through to `setupDomain()` when a new user wants to setup a subname.

## Setting Everything Up

Once you have a parent name ready and a subname registrar contract deployed, then you just need a few extra steps to set everything up:

### (If needed) Call setupDomain on your contract

This will only apply to you if you have a specific `setupDomain` method or something similar on your contract, such as the [reference implementation](/wrapper/creating-subname-registrar#reference-implementation) contracts do.

Calling this method will "enable" a specific parent name in your subname registrar. It can also allow you to set or update the pricing terms or beneficiary account, if needed.

### Approve your contract

Call `setApprovalForAll` on the NameWrapper contract, approving your subname registrar contract as an operator for any names you own. This allows you to keep ownership of the parent name, and just delegate subname creation to your contract.

### (If needed) Approve token spending

If your registrar contract takes ERC-20 tokens as a registration fee, then a potential registrant will need to approve your contract as a spender first.

### Register a subname

Finally, the registrant will call your public registration method. Upon transaction success, they will own the wrapped name (ERC-1155 NFT) with whatever fuse/expiry guarantees that you setup in your registrar.

If you are allowing "forever" subnames to be registered (meaning that you've burned the `CAN_EXTEND_EXPIRY` fuse on the subnames), then the registrant can extend their own expiry at any time. Note that a subname's expiry can be set up to a maximum of whatever the parent name's expiry is.

And that's it!

# Name Wrapper Fuses

A "fuse" is a permission or perk that can be granted/revoked on a name. As the name implies, once the fuse is "burned", it cannot be unburned.

Fuses will only reset when the **expiry** is reached. In the ENS Manager UI, this is available in the "Permissions" section of the name.

By **wrapped expiry**, we mean that for .eth second-level names (like `name.eth`), this is the end of the 90-day grace period, the time at which the .eth 2LD is truly released. For all other names (such as subnames), there is no grace period, so the expiry is just the expiration date for that specific subname.

For example, by default when you wrap a name, you can transfer that NFT around freely, just as you can with other NFTs. However, if the **`CANNOT_TRANSFER`** fuse is burned, then the NFT becomes non-transferrable. In the ENS Manager UI, you would do this by revoking the "Can send this name" permission.

In order to burn fuses on a name, the parent name must be **Locked** (meaning, you cannot unwrap the name). The reason is, if the parent name was not locked, then the owner of the parent name could simply get around the constraints of the Name Wrapper by unwrapping the name, and replacing/revoking subnames against the core ENS Registry.

There are parent-controlled and owner-controlled fuses:

## Parent-Controlled Fuses

Only the owner of the parent name can burn one of these fuses on a name. These can generally be thought of as "perks" that can be granted to a name, though they can be used in other ways.

| Fuse name                   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **`PARENT_CANNOT_CONTROL`** | Allows a parent owner to **Emancipate** a child name. After this is burned, the parent will no longer be able to burn any further fuses, and will no longer be able to replace/delete the child name. This fuse must be burned in order for any owner-controlled fuses to be burned on the name. |
| **`IS_DOT_ETH`**            | This fuse cannot be burned by users of the Name Wrapper, it is only set internally when a .eth 2LD is wrapped.                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| **`CAN_EXTEND_EXPIRY`**     | The owner of the child name will be able to extend their own expiry. Normally, only the parent owner can extend the expiry of a child name. See the [Expiry](/wrapper/expiry) section for more information.                                                                                      |
| **Custom Fuses**            | There are 13 other parent-controlled fuses that are not reserved, and can be used in any custom way you want!                                                                                                                                                                                    |

## Owner-Controlled Fuses

Either the owner of the name or the owner of the parent name can burn one of these fuses. These can generally be thought of as "permissions" that can be revoked on a name, though they can be used in other ways.

| Fuse name                     | Description                                                                                                                                                       |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **`CANNOT_UNWRAP`**           | The name will now be **Locked**, and can no longer be unwrapped. This fuse must be burned in order for any other owner-controlled fuses to be burned on the name. |
| **`CANNOT_BURN_FUSES`**       | No further fuses can be burned on the name.                                                                                                                       |
| **`CANNOT_TRANSFER`**         | The name (wrapped NFT) can no longer be transferred.                                                                                                              |
| **`CANNOT_SET_RESOLVER`**     | The resolver contract for the name can no longer be updated.                                                                                                      |
| **`CANNOT_SET_TTL`**          | The TTL for the name can no longer be updated.                                                                                                                    |
| **`CANNOT_CREATE_SUBDOMAIN`** | New subdomains can no longer be created.                                                                                                                          |
| **`CANNOT_APPROVE`**          | The approved "subname renewal manager" for the name can no longer be updated. See the [Approved Operators](#approved-operators) section for more information.     |
| **Custom Fuses**              | There are 9 other owner-controlled fuses that are not reserved, and can be used in any custom way you want!                                                       |

## The Emancipated and Locked States

This is also covered in the <a href="/wrapper/states">Wrapped States</a> section, but here is a quick recap:

All .eth second-level names (like `name.eth`) are automatically placed into the Emancipated state when wrapped.

**Emancipated** means that the parent no longer has control over the child name. It can no longer burn any fuses or replace the subname, up until the expiry.

A name is Emancipated when the parent burns the **`PARENT_CANNOT_CONTROL`** (PCC) fuse. The parent must first be in the Locked state to be able to do this.

**Locked** means that the name cannot be unwrapped. This provides assurance to subnames that the parent owner cannot unwrap and then, for example, start replacing subnames directly against the registry.

An Emancipated name is Locked when the **`CANNOT_UNWRAP`** (CU) fuse is burned.

Think of the special PCC / CU fuses recursively:

- To burn owner-controlled or subname fuses, CU must be burned.
- To burn CU, PCC must be burned.
- Only the parent can burn PCC on the child name, and only if CU is first burned on the parent.
- Only the grandparent can burn PCC on the parent name, and only if CU is first burned on the grandparent.
- And so on...

Follow that chain up until you hit a .eth second-level name like `name.eth`, since .eth second-level names will have PCC automatically burned when wrapping. The parent `eth` node is already in the Locked state.

A parent name can burn all the fuses it needs to on a child name in one transaction. This can be done when the subname is created, or on an existing subname that has not yet been Emancipated.

## DNS Domains and Fuses

Currently, only .eth names support fuses, because only the `eth` node is on-chain native and completely locked beyond anyone's control.

Technically speaking, the owner of a DNS TLD has the ability to burn fuses on that TLD in the Name Wrapper, and set it to the "Locked" state. And then from there, all subnames under that DNS TLD _will_ be able to use fuses.

The DNS TLD owner would need to:

- Request the Controller of that TLD from the ENS DAO
- Wrap the TLD node in the Name Wrapper
- Burn the **`PARENT_CANNOT_CONTROL`** and **`CANNOT_UNWRAP`** fuses on the wrapped TLD to lock it

However, this still does not have all the immutable guarantees that .eth names do. This is because for DNS names, the "source of truth" always lies not in the Ethereum network, but in the DNS network, and the DNS root zone governed by ICANN stakeholders.

So even if the DNS TLD owner "Locks" that TLD in the ENS Name Wrapper, if that TLD were to ever change ownership on the DNS side, then (per the [ENS DAO Constitution](https://docs.ens.domains/v/governance/ens-dao-constitution#iv.-ens-integrates-with-the-global-namespace)) the new owner would be able to override control of that TLD on the ENS side, unwrap it, and replace/revoke all 2LDs. This is just something to keep in mind for wrapped DNS domains.

Even if wrapped DNS domains do not support fuses, you can still use them as ERC-1155 NFTs. They will still have their own NFT metadata and show up in your wallet, with whatever avatar you have set, etc. They just won't have all the extra functionality that comes with the fuse/permission system.

# Name Wrapper Expiry

In order to burn any fuses on a name, you must also set an **expiry** on it. This expiry determines how long any burned fuses are active for, and may also determine whether the name itself has expired.

If the name is a .eth 2LD, then the expiry will automatically be set to the same expiry in the .eth Registrar. But for all other names, the parent can choose what expiry to set for a child name.

## Max Expiry for Subnames

By default, the expiry for a name can only be set by the parent, and can only be increased, not decreased. The maximum value for the expiry of a name is the expiry of its parent name.

For example, say a name expires in 5 years. The owner of the name can then set the expiry of its subnames to a maximum of 5 years as well. But the parent could also choose to set the expiry to something less. Let's say the parent sets the expiry of one of its subnames to 2 years.

Then in turn, the owner of the subname can set the expiry of its own subnames up to a maximum of 2 years, but it could also set it to something less, like 1 year.

<Card>
  <img src="/img/namewrapper-expiry-subnames.jpg" alt="Expiry Diagram" />
</Card>

The parent can set a different expiry for different subnames too, just as it can burn different fuses for different subnames.

## Renewals

When a wrapped .eth second-level name (like `name.eth`) is renewed, that new expiry is automatically set in the Name Wrapper as well as in the .eth Registrar. However, the expiry for any other .eth names (like `sub.name.eth`) will not be automatically extended when the parent expiry is extended.

The parent can extend the expiry for an existing subname at any time, even if the subname has been emancipated.

The parent can also choose to approve a separate contract to allow the expiry for subnames to be extended by the subname owner or other accounts.

That is basically how .eth second-level names work: Since the `eth` node is locked in the registrar contract and has the Name Wrapper (which exposes a renew method) approved as a controller, .eth second-level names can be directly renewed by their owners.

The parent can further lock this approved contract in by burning the **`CANNOT_APPROVE`** fuse.

There is also a special parent-controlled fuse called **`CAN_EXTEND_EXPIRY`**. If the parent burns this fuse on a subname, then the owner of that subname (or any approved controller) can also extend the expiry.

So, if you are running a subname registrar and you want to enable "unruggable renewals", you can use one of the above options (or both).

## Special Cases for .eth 2LDs

For .eth second-level names, the end of the name's grace period (from the .eth Registrar) is used for the expiry inside of the Name Wrapper.

So if the name's expiration date in the Registrar is January 1st, then the expiry in the Name Wrapper will reflect that date _plus_ the grace period (currently 90 days, so approximately April 1st, depending on the year).

When the name's expiration date (from the .eth Registrar) has been reached, and the name is now in the grace period, all Name Wrapper operations on the name will be restricted.

The owner will _not_ yet lose ownership of the name, but they will also not be able to unwrap or update the name until it has been renewed.

## Expiry Implications

When a name is merely **Wrapped** but not **Emancipated** or **Locked**, parent-controlled fuses can still be burned. This means that the parent can burn a custom fuse for a limited amount of time.

When the expiry (end of grace period for .eth 2LDs) is reached, all fuses will be reset, but the name will otherwise be unaffected.

When a name is **Emancipated** or **Locked**, the expiry has an important additional effect. In this scenario, when the expiry (end of grace period for .eth 2LDs) has been reached, **the name itself will expire**, and the owner **loses ownership** of the name.

# Name Wrapper Use-Cases

## Lock the resolved records for a name

By default, newly registered names will use the Public Resolver, which just allows the current manager/controller of the name to update any records.

However, in some cases perhaps you want to make sure that a name resolves to specific records and **never** changes. You can accomplish this with the **`CANNOT_SET_RESOLVER`** fuse.

Say you own `mycoolcontract.eth` representing a smart contract. You can use ENS subnames to refer to specific versions of that contract, like `1.mycoolcontract.eth`. And perhaps you want those versioned subnames to always point to:

- The ETH address of that immutable contract
- The ABI for that contract
- The contenthash for some versioned documentation page
- etc.

One way to do this is just to make sure the name is **Locked**, all the records are set correctly, and then transfer the owner to some burn address so it can never be updated again.

But of course this isn't ideal, because maybe there are some records that you _do_ want to update in the future. Or maybe you still want to keep ownership of that subname for other reasons.

Instead of essentially burning the name, you could create a custom resolver that locks in certain records forever. Then:

1. Set the resolver of that name to your custom contract
2. Set the records however you want and lock them into the resolver
3. Burn these fuses on the name:
   - `PARENT_CANNOT_CONTROL | CANNOT_UNWRAP | CANNOT_SET_RESOLVER`

Now you can still keep ownership and even some limited management power over the name, while still guaranteeing that the ETH address, ABI, and whatever other records are completely immutable, as long as the expiry is set appropriately.

## Issue subdomains as tickets to an event

Maybe you have `mycoolevent.eth` and you want to issue tickets like `1.ticket.2023.mycoolevent.eth`.

If you want, you can choose to not Emancipate those subnames, but still burn some custom parent-controlled fuses. Those fuses might:

- Indicate what "tier" their event ticket is
  - Maybe they can upgrade their ticket to a higher tier, which would burn some additional fuses
- Allow them access to the express line or some VIP room
  - Maybe even automatically via some smart door

When you burn those fuses, perhaps you also set the expiry to the day after the event ends.

Or, maybe you want your attendees to be able to keep their subnames as a souvenir or proof-of-attendance!

If so, then instead of letting the names expire at the end of the event, you could extend the expiry and burn some additional fuses to allow the attendees to keep them forever! In that case you might want to burn these fuses:

- `CAN_EXTEND_EXPIRY | PARENT_CANNOT_CONTROL`

If you want those tickets to be non-transferrable (soulbound to the address that attended), then burn these fuses:

- `CAN_EXTEND_EXPIRY | PARENT_CANNOT_CONTROL | CANNOT_UNWRAP | CANNOT_TRANSFER`

## Sell or rent subnames

### I want to sell / rent out subnames!

Say you own the wrapped name `verypopularname.eth`. Obviously you can just manually create wrapped subnames like `my.verypopularname.eth` and then sell them on an NFT marketplace. But that sure doesn't scale well.

To accomplish this, you will want to create a **subname registrar**. This is a contract that will handle all the registration / renewal for you, and then users will be able to interact with that contract in order to register their own subnames.

In fact, this is exactly how .eth 2LDs are registered. The owner of the `eth` TLD (the NFT contract) delegates registration / renewal to the ETHRegistrarController contract. It is acting as a subname registrar for the name `eth`.

Your contract would expose a `register` method that anyone can call. Under the hood it will use the [setSubnodeOwner](https://github.com/ensdomains/ens-contracts/tree/master/contracts/wrapper#setsubnodeowner) or [setSubnodeRecord](https://github.com/ensdomains/ens-contracts/tree/master/contracts/wrapper#setsubnoderecord) methods to create subnames, passing in the **fuses** and **expiry** you want to set.

### What fuses should I burn???

First, note that if you want to burn any fuses on subnames, then your name must be **Locked** (meaning **`CANNOT_UNWRAP`** is burned).

Assuming that you want your subnames to be "unruggable", such that you cannot replace / revoke them, then you will want to burn **`PARENT_CANNOT_CONTROL`** on the subnames. This will place them in the **Emancipated** state upon registration.

If you want to sell "forever" subnames, where users register once and can then keep them for as long as they wish, then you can consider burning the **`CAN_EXTEND_EXPIRY`** fuse.

This will allow the subname owner to extend their own expiry whenever they want. The max expiry is the expiry of the parent name, but the .eth Registrar allows _anyone_ to renew/extend a .eth 2LD as well.

If you just want to **rent** subnames, then do not burn **`CAN_EXTEND_EXPIRY`**. Instead, you could include a `renew` method on your contract that users can call for another fee.

If you want to enable "unruggable renewals" for your registrar, to guarantee that users will always be able to renew, then you can call `approve` on the Name Wrapper and approve your registrar contract as the "subname renewal manager" for your name.

Then, burn the **`CANNOT_APPROVE`** fuse on your name, to guarantee that you can never revoke that contract for subname renewals. See the <a href="#approved-operators">Approved Operators</a> section above for more info.

If you want to impose other restrictions on your registered subnames, then you can burn the **`CANNOT_UNWRAP`** fuse to Lock the subname, and also burn whatever other fuses you want.

For example, if you want to prevent owners of your subnames (like `my.verypopularname.eth` from creating their own subnames (like `buy.my.verypopularname.eth`), then you would burn **`CANNOT_UNWRAP`** and **`CANNOT_CREATE_SUBDOMAIN`**.

To recap on fuses...

- Sell permanent names:
  - `CAN_EXTEND_EXPIRY | PARENT_CANNOT_CONTROL`
- Sell permanent names, but prevent them from creating their own subnames:
  - `CAN_EXTEND_EXPIRY | PARENT_CANNOT_CONTROL | CANNOT_UNWRAP | CANNOT_CREATE_SUBDOMAIN`
- Rent out names:
  - `PARENT_CANNOT_CONTROL`
- Rent out names, but prevent them from transferring or reselling them:
  - `PARENT_CANNOT_CONTROL | CANNOT_UNWRAP | CANNOT_TRANSFER`

And so on, it's up to you. You can also burn whatever custom parent-controlled or owner-controlled fuses you want to.

### Can I customize my own rules and fees?

Yes! It's your registrar contract, so you can impose whatever rules and fees you want.

For example, the .eth Registrar imposes a 3-character minimum on all names, as well as a <a href="https://support.ens.domains/core/registration/fees">custom fee structure</a> and a <a href="https://support.ens.domains/core/registration/temporary-premium">temporary premium auction</a> upon expiration.

By default there is no character limit on subnames, but your contract could have its own rules and fee structure or whatever you want. For example, you can:

- Allow or disallow specific addresses from registering / renewing
- Only allow registration based on some custom criteria like holding a specific NFT
- Custom length restrictions like only 3+ characters or < 100 characters
- Only allow names with characters `[a-z0-9]` and nothing else
- Use a custom fee structure based on:
  - The length of the name
  - The specific characters that are in the name, like emojis
  - A pre-curated list of "good" names like people's first names
- And whatever other rules you want.

### More information

See this page for a step-by-step guide on creating and setting up your own subname registrar: <a href="/wrapper/creating-subname-registrar">Creating a Subname Registrar</a>

There is even a set of <a href="/wrapper/creating-subname-registrar#reference-implementation">reference implementation contracts</a> you can use as a starting base!

## Give subnames out to NFT holders

### I want to give subnames out to all of my DAO members / NFT holders!

Say you own the wrapped name `mycoolnft.eth`, representing a popular NFT project you created. You want to distribute subnames like `6529.mycoolnft.eth` to all holders.

One option is to just bulk create the subnames and drop the wrapped NFTs into their wallets. This might be good at least as an initial drop, because then the holders don't need to interact with any contract or spend any gas, you're doing that for them!

To create the subnames, you'd use the <a href="https://github.com/ensdomains/ens-contracts/tree/master/contracts/wrapper#setsubnodeowner">setSubnodeOwner</a> or <a href="https://github.com/ensdomains/ens-contracts/tree/master/contracts/wrapper#setsubnoderecord">setSubnodeRecord</a> methods.

You must also decide:

### How much control over the subnames do you want to relinquish?

Do you want to be able to revoke subnames? Or do you want them to be completely outside your control?

One thing to consider is whether you want the **current** holder of your NFT to always be able to claim/reclaim the corresponding ENS subname. If so, then you will **not** want to Emancipate those subnames (in other words, do not burn **`PARENT_CANNOT_CONTROL`**).

If the subname is Emancipated, then the NFT holder could sell/transfer the NFT but keep the subname (up until the expiry).

To make it easy for anyone to claim/reclaim a subname after your initial drop, you can set up a contract for this.

### Setting up a subname claim contract

The claim method of your contract could:

1. Call `ownerOf` or `balanceOf` on your NFT contract to get or verify the current owner of the NFT
2. Call `ownerOf` or `balanceOf` on the ENS Name Wrapper contract to get or verify the current owner of the wrapped subname
   - If both owner addresses are the same, just return, nothing to do
3. Call `setSubnodeOwner` or `setSubnodeRecord` on the ENS Name Wrapper:
   - **owner:** The current owner of the NFT
   - **fuses:** What fuses you want to burn (if any) on that subname. If you burn any fuses, you must also set an expiry.
   - **expiry:** When the subname will expire.

Then, to give that contract access to create subnames on your behalf, you would call `setApprovalForAll` on the Name Wrapper to approve your contract as an operator.

Now, even if the NFT gets sold / transferred, the new owner will be able to claim their `mycoolnft.eth` subname at any time.

In addition, if you expand your NFT collection in the future and there are new owners, then those new owners would be able to claim their subnames as well.

If you are creating a new NFT contract, you could even bake this functionality **directly into the NFT contract** too, instead of needing a separate contract! By doing this, you wouldn't need a separate `claim` method either, your NFT contract would just **automatically transfer the wrapped ENS subname** whenever the NFT itself gets transferred!

### Giving your subname owners perks

If you decide to not Emancipate the subnames that you issue, you _will_ still be able to burn any Parent-Controlled Fuses. There are 13 unreserved parent-controlled fuses that you can use however you wish!

For example, perhaps you want to grant on-chain "perks" or "roles" to certain holders. You would call [setChildFuses](https://github.com/ensdomains/ens-contracts/tree/master/contracts/wrapper#setchildfuses) on the Name Wrapper and pass in the fuses you want to burn, and the expiry.

This means that those "perks" or "roles" can also be time-boxed if you want. Maybe a perk expires in 1 week or something, up to you.

There is also the reserved **`CAN_EXTEND_EXPIRY`** parent-controlled fuse. If you burn this, then the subname owner will be able to extend their own expiry whenever they want.

# Name Wrapper Contract Details

The Name Wrapper contract is deployed on these chains:

- Mainnet: [wrapper.ens.eth](https://etherscan.io/address/0xD4416b13d2b3a9aBae7AcD5D6C2BbDBE25686401#code) ( `0xD4416b13d2b3a9aBae7AcD5D6C2BbDBE25686401` )
- Sepolia: [wrapper.ens.eth](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0x0635513f179D50A207757E05759CbD106d7dFcE8#code) ( `0x0635513f179D50A207757E05759CbD106d7dFcE8` )

## Wrapping and Unwrapping

When wrapping a .eth 2LD, you transfer the Owner (Registrant) of the ERC-721 NFT to the Name Wrapper contract.

The contract will then automatically take over the Manager (Controller) for the name as well.

You can do this by calling the <a href="https://github.com/ensdomains/ens-contracts/tree/master/contracts/wrapper#wrapeth2ld">wrapETH2LD</a> method. Or, you can directly transfer the ERC-721 NFT to the Name Wrapper contract. In return, the contract issues you an ERC-1155 NFT.

```solidity
NameWrapper.wrapETH2LD(string label, address wrappedOwner, uint16 ownerControlledFuses, address resolver)

// For example
wrapETH2LD(
    "myname", // "myname.eth" but only the label
    0x1234..., // The address you want to own the wrapped name
    0, // The owner-controlled fuse bits OR'd together, that you want to burn
    0x1234... // The address of the resolver you want to use
)
```

When wrapping any other ENS name, you transfer the Manager (Controller) of the name to the Name Wrapper contract. You can do this by calling the <a href="https://github.com/ensdomains/ens-contracts/tree/master/contracts/wrapper#wrap">wrap</a> method. In return, the contract issues you an ERC-1155 NFT.

```solidity
NameWrapper.wrap(bytes name, address wrappedOwner, address resolver)

// For example
wrapETH2LD(
    0x03737562046e616d650365746800, // The DNS-encoded version of "sub.myname.eth"
    0x1234..., // The address you want to own the wrapped name
    0x1234... // The address of the resolver you want to use
)
```

As the owner of the wrapped name, you can unwrap at any time by calling either <a href="https://github.com/ensdomains/ens-contracts/tree/master/contracts/wrapper#unwrapeth2ld">unwrapETH2LD</a> or <a href="https://github.com/ensdomains/ens-contracts/tree/master/contracts/wrapper#unwrap">unwrap</a>. You can do this as long as the permission to unwrap has not been revoked.

```solidity
NameWrapper.unwrapETH2LD(bytes32 labelhash, address registrant, address controller)

// For example
unwrapETH2LD(
    0x952f..., // "myname.eth" but only the labelhash: keccak256('myname')
    0x1234..., // The address you want to own the unwrapped name
    0x1234... // The address you want to be the manager of the unwrapped name
)

NameWrapper.unwrap(bytes32 parentNode, bytes32 labelhash, address controller)

// For example
unwrap(
    0x6cbc..., // The namehash of the parent node, e.g. "myname.eth"
    0xfa1e..., // The labelhash of the child to unwrap, e.g. keccak256('sub')
    0x1234... // The address you want to be the manager of the unwrapped name
)
```

## Burning Fuses / Setting Expiry

If you are wrapping an existing .eth 2LD, then you can pass in the owner-controlled fuses at that time, see the above [Wrapping and Unwrapping](#wrapping-and-unwrapping) section. If you are creating a new subname, and you want to burn fuses at the same time, see the below [Creating Subnames](#creating-subnames) section.

For other existing wrapped names, you can burn fuses with either the `setFuses` or `setChildFuses` methods.

The `setFuses` method is used for a name that you own, but you do not necessarily own the parent of. You have the ability to burn any [Owner-Controlled Fuses](/wrapper/fuses#owner-controlled-fuses) you want. Note that your name must first be [Emancipated](/wrapper/states#emancipated) in order for you to be able to burn any owner-controlled fuses. All .eth 2LDs are automatically emancipated upon wrapping.

When burning owner-controlled fuses, at a minimum you must burn the **`CANNOT_UNWRAP`** fuse (if it has not already been burned).

```solidity
NameWrapper.setFuses(bytes32 node, uint16 ownerControlledFuses)

// For example
setFuses(
    0x6cbc..., // The namehash of the node, e.g. "myname.eth"
    1 // The owner-controlled fuse bits OR'd together, that you want to burn
)
```

The `setChildFuses` method is used for a subname that you own the parent of. As long as the subname has not yet been [Emancipated](/wrapper/states#emancipated), you can burn whatever [Parent-Controlled Fuses](/wrapper/fuses#parent-controlled-fuses) and [Owner-Controlled Fuses](/wrapper/fuses#owner-controlled-fuses) you want. At the same time, you must set an expiry for those fuses, if one is not already set. Note that your name must first be [Locked](/wrapper/states#locked) in order for you to burn fuses on any subnames.

If you are only burning parent-controlled fuses, then there are no further restrictions. However, if you are burning owner-controlled fuses, then you must at a minimum burn both **`PARENT_CANNOT_CONTROL`** and **`CANNOT_UNWRAP`** on the subname to lock it at the same time.

```solidity
NameWrapper.setChildFuses(bytes32 parentNode, bytes32 labelhash, uint32 fuses, uint64 expiry)

// For example
setChildFuses(
    0x6cbc..., // The namehash of the parent node, e.g. "myname.eth"
    0xfa1e..., // The labelhash of the child, e.g. keccak256('sub')
    65537, // The fuse bits OR'd together, that you want to burn
    2021232060 // The expiry for the subname
)
```

## Creating Subnames

This is done very similarly to how unwrapped subnames are created. You call either `setSubnodeOwner` or `setSubnodeRecord` on the wrapper contract. When a name is wrapped, all subnames created will also be wrapped by default.

You can also pass in the fuses and expiry at the same time, so that the subname will be created in the fuse/permission state that you want, without needing to perform an extra transaction.

```solidity
NameWrapper.setSubnodeOwner(bytes32 parentNode, string label, address owner, uint32 fuses, uint64 expiry)

// For example
setSubnodeOwner(
    0x6cbc..., // The namehash of the parent node, e.g. "myname.eth"
    "sub", // The label of the subname to create
    0x1234..., // The address you want to be the owner of the new subname
    65536, // The fuse bits OR'd together, that you want to burn
    2021232060 // The expiry for the subname
)

NameWrapper.setSubnodeRecord(bytes32 parentNode, string label, address owner, address resolver, uint64 ttl, uint32 fuses, uint64 expiry)

// For example
setSubnodeRecord(
    0x6cbc..., // The namehash of the parent node, e.g. "myname.eth"
    "sub", // The label of the subname to create
    0x1234..., // The address you want to be the owner of the new subname
    0x5678..., // The address of the resolver to set for the new subname
    0, // The TTL to set for the new subname
    65536, // The fuse bits OR'd together, that you want to burn
    2021232060 // The expiry for the subname
)
```

## Approved Operators

### Full-Control Operator Batch Approvals

Your wrapped name is an ERC-1155 NFT that supports the `setApprovalForAll` method. When you approve an address using this method, it will have **full control** over all wrapped ENS names that you own.

This method is typically used by NFT marketplace contracts.

### Name-Specific Subname Renewal Manager Approvals

The Name Wrapper also supports the ERC-721 `approve` method. This method is used to approve a single "Subname Renewal Manager" for a specific name.

The "Renewal Manager" does not have full control over your wrapped name, it can only set / extend the expiry on subnames.

Further, if you burn the **`CANNOT_APPROVE`** fuse on your name, then the approved renewal manager can no longer be changed. You can use this to "lock in" that contract, so that you can guarantee to all subname owners that renewals/extensions can always be done.

This approved renewal manager will be reset if the wrapped NFT is burned or re-minted, which happens if you unwrap the name, or if an expired name gets re-registered. It will also be reset if the wrapped NFT is transferred, **unless** the **`CANNOT_APPROVE`** fuse is burned.

### Example - Subname Registrar Contract

You can use these operator approval methods to setup a separate contract that can take certain actions on your behalf. One example is setting up a "subname registrar" to allow users to register/renew subnames.

That subname registrar contract would act on your behalf and allow users to register subnames. To allow this, you would call `setApprovalForAll` to give that contract full control over your name (and thus the ability to create subnames).

Then, to enable "unruggable renewals", you could call `approve` on that same contract (or a separate one specific to renewals if you wish) and burn **`CANNOT_APPROVE`** to lock in subname renewals for that contract.

If you need to later on, you would still be able to revoke with `setApprovalForAll`. So the contract would lose full control over your name (and the ability to create new subnames), but it would still be able to perpetually renew/extend existing subnames.

And you can do all of this **without** needing to send your wrapped NFT to that contract.

# Wrapped States

```mermaid
graph LR;
  unregistered((Unregistered));
  unwrapped(Unwrapped);

  emancipated(Emancipated);

  wrapped--->|protect|emancipated;
  emancipated--->|lock|locked;
  emancipated--->|unwrap|unwrapped;
  emancipated--->|expire|unregistered;
  locked-->|expire|unregistered;
```

Taking the Name Wrapper into account, an ENS name can be in one of these possible states:

### Unregistered

The name has not even been registered/created yet, or it has expired.

### Unwrapped

The name exists and has not expired (in the case of .eth second-level names). The Name Wrapper contract does not have ownership over the name. You own the name in the registry and/or .eth registrar.

### Wrapped

The Name Wrapper contract has ownership of the name (in the registry/registrar). You are issued an ERC-1155 NFT in return, which proves that you are the actual owner.

You can unwrap the name at any time, which burns the ERC-1155 NFT, and returns ownership in the registry/registrar back to you.

If your name is a subname like `sub.name.eth`, then the owner of `name.eth` can technically replace the subname and transfer it to a different owner.

In addition, the parent owner can burn parent-controlled fuses on your name.

### Emancipated

The owner of the parent name is no longer able to replace this name, or burn any additional fuses on it. All .eth second-level names (like `name.eth`) are automatically put into the Emancipated state when they are wrapped.

The name can still be unwrapped and rewrapped by the owner.

### Locked

The name can no longer be unwrapped. The owner can now burn owner-controlled fuses on the name. Fuses for subnames of this name can now be burned as well.

The **Name Wrapper** is a contract for ENS that allows you to "wrap" any ENS name into a ERC-1155 NFT.

## Without the Name Wrapper

Before the Name Wrapper, only .eth 2LDs (second-level domains, like `ens.eth`) had ERC-721 NFTs associated with them, unless the owner created a separate custom contract.

</Card>

## With the Name Wrapper

<img src="/img/namewrapper-overview-wrapped.jpg" alt="Name Wrapper Diagram" />

**Parent-Controlled Fuses:**

- [Fuses](/wrapper/fuses) that only the parent owner can burn
- "Perks" that can be given to the owner of a name

**Example:** By burning `CAN_EXTEND_EXPIRY`, you allow the owner to
extend/renew their own subname

**Owner-Controlled Fuses:**

- [Fuses](/wrapper/fuses) that either the owner or parent owner can burn
- "Permissions" that can be revoked on a name

**Example:** By burning `CANNOT_TRANSFER`, the wrapped NFT can no longer be
transferred or sold.

**Subname Fuses:**

- The parent owner has the power to burn fuses when creating subnames
- Decides what perks, permissions, or guarantees to give to subname owners

With this new contract, you can wrap:

- Any .eth name or subname (e.g. `name.eth`, `sub.name.eth`)
- Any DNS name or subname (e.g. `name.com`, `sub.name.com`)

Unwrapped .eth 2LDs have the concept of a separate **Owner** (Registrant) and **Manager** (Controller).

This changes after you wrap the name, because there is only a single account that serves as both the **Owner** and **Manager** for the wrapped name.

# Terminology

This page contains a glossary of terms used in the ENS documentation.

## Name

An ENS identifier such as 'alice.eth'. Names may consist of multiple parts, called labels, separated by dots. This also includes DNS names like `name.xyz`, or subnames like `sub.name.eth`.

## 2LD

Second-level domain.
This refers to a subname/subdomain of a top-level domain.
For example, `name.eth` and `name.com` are both second-level names.
A subname of a 2LD is a third-level domain or 3LD.

## Subname / Subdomain

A child name like `sub.name.eth`, whose parent is `name.eth`. Also referred to as a "subdomain". Every name (except for the root node) has a parent. For example, `name.eth` is a subname of `eth`.

```
vault.luc.eth
```

## TLD

Top-level domain. This refers to names like `eth`, `com`, `xyz` which lie at the "top" of the naming hierarchy.

```
.eth .com .xyz
```

## Controller

The account that may edit the records of a name. The Controller may be changed by the Registrant or Controller.

## Label

An individual component of a name, such as 'alice'.

## Labelhash

The keccak256 hash of an individual label.

## Namehash

The algorithm used to process an ENS name and return a cryptographic hash uniquely identifying that name. Namehash takes a name as input and produces a _node_.

## Node

A cryptographic hash uniquely identifying a name.

## Owner

The owner of a name is the entity referenced in the ENS registry's owner field. An owner may transfer ownership, set a resolver or TTL, and create or reassign subdomains.

## Record

A piece of information that an ENS name "resolves" to (points to). The most common record is the ETH Address record, which determines what ETH 0x address an ENS name points to.

## Registration

A registration is a registrar's record of a user's ownership of a name. This is distinct from the owner field in the Registry; registrations are maintained in the registrar contract and additionally store information on expiry date, fees paid, etc.

### Registrar

A registrar is a contract responsible for allocating subdomains. Registrars can be configured at any level of ENS, and are pointed to by the owner field of the registry.

### Registrant

The owner of a registration. The registrant may transfer the registration, set the Controller, and reclaim ownership of the name in the registry if required.

### Registry

The core contract of ENS, the registry maintains a mapping from domain name (at any level - x, y.x, z.y.x etc) to owner, resolver, and time-to-live. All lookups start with the Registry.

### Expiry

The date and time at which an ENS name expires.
The implications of expiration depend on the type of name it is.
When a .eth 2LD expires (and its grace period elapses), then you lose ownership of the name.
When a wrapped subname expires, you may or may not lose ownership, depending on whether the name was emancipated.

### Grace Period

This is a short window of time after an ENS .eth name expires, in which the owner can still renew and retain the name. Currently this window is 90 days.

### TTL

Stands for "Time To Live". This is a field in the core registry that can be set alongside the resolver. It can be used as a hint for clients to decide how long to cache resolved data.

## DNS

This is the Domain Name Service used by the internet to resolve addresses and other records from human-readable names. ENS aims to be fully complementary and compatible with DNS, and supports easy importing of DNS names via a special [DNSSEC](#dnssec) registrar.

### DNSSEC

Stands for Domain Name System Security Extensions. When a particular DNS TLD supports DNSSEC, then the owners of names can cryptographically sign records. This allows ENS to support easy importing of DNS names into the ENS registry, as the owner of the DNS name can prove ownership with those signed records.

## Resolver

A resolver is a contract that maps from name to the resource (e.g., cryptocurrency addresses, content hash, etc). Resolvers are pointed to by the resolver field of the registry.

### Wildcard Resolver

This refers to a resolver that supports [ENSIP-10](/ensip/10). This scheme allows clients to resolve data for subnames that either don't have a resolver of their own, or subnames that may not even exist on-chain at all. For offchain names, this is typically used in conjunction with [CCIP Read](#ccip-read).

## Public Resolver

This is a standard resolver contract implementation written by ENS Labs. It supports all record types and anyone can use it. This is the default resolver used when registering a new name via the official manager app.

## Offchain

This term is typically used with respect to the Ethereum Mainnet blockchain. If data is not posted to the chain via an actual Ethereum Mainnet transaction, then it is "offchain". ENS names can also be offchain. For example names can use a special resolver to resolve records for subnames that don't exist on-chain in the Registry. This is also typically done with [CCIP Read](#ccip-read).

### CCIP Read

The "Cross Chain Interoperability Protocol Read" specification, also known as [EIP-3668](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3668), authored by Nick Johnson, is a specification that allows for secure and trustless offchain data retrieval.

It allows for an Ethereum call to defer to an [offchain gateway](/resolvers/ccip-read#writing-a-gateway) and then securely verify the resulting data on-chain.
With respect to ENS, this is typically used for offchain subnames that don't exist in the core Registry.

## Primary Name

The ENS name that you want a particular ETH account to be associated with. When set, it will be displayed instead of your 0x address on integrating websites/apps. This is also often referred to as the "reverse record".

### Reverse Node

A node in the Registry that can be claimed for any Ethereum account. The name this node represents is `[addr].addr.reverse`, where `[addr]` is the Ethereum public address (lowercase, without the "0x"). These reverse nodes are typically used to set a [Primary Name](#primary-name) for an account.

### Reverse Record

Usually, this is referring to the [Primary Name](#primary-name). Technically speaking, a [Reverse Node](#reverse-node) can have multiple records set on it, the same as any node.

## NameWrapper

### Wrapped Name

The [ENS Name Wrapper](/wrapper/overview) is a contract for ENS that allows you to "wrap" any ENS name into a ERC-1155 NFT. This includes not only .eth 2LDs like `name.eth`, but also DNS names like `name.xyz`, or subnames like `sub.name.eth`.

### Fuse

The technical term for a specific "permission" bit for a wrapped name. As the name implies, once that bit is flipped on, the fuse is burnt and cannot be unburnt (unless the name expires).

## Subgraph

An indexed collection of data using TheGraph protocol.
In this documentation portal, "the subgraph" usually refers to the official ENS subgraph maintained by ENS Labs.
This is a useful offchain service that allows clients to query for information about names or accounts.

---

# Resolvers Quickstart

At the heart of every ENS name is its resolver. A resolver is a smart contract that implements a specific set of Resolver features (see [Resolver Interface](/resolvers/interfaces)).
The resolvers smart contract functions have control over the resolution process of a ["node"](/resolution/names#namehash) (a name or subdomain) and onwards (subdomains of itself).

## Basic Resolver

A naive but very plausible example of a resolver is the following.

```solidity
contract MyResolver {
    function addr(bytes32 node) external pure returns (address) {
        return 0x225f137127d9067788314bc7fcc1f36746a3c3B5;
    }

    function supportsInterface(
        bytes4 interfaceID
    ) external pure returns (bool) {
        return
            interfaceID == this.addr.selector ||
            interfaceID == this.supportsInterface.selector;
    }
}
```

Notice how the above would always return the same address regardless of the name it is queried for.

If you want to [write your own resolver resolver](/resolvers/writing), or see the [interface reference](/resolvers/interfaces).

## Public Resolver

The default resolver for all names is the Public Resolver, a swiss army knife of resolvers, written by the ENS Labs team, feature-packed with everything your everyday user might need.
You can read more about the [Public Resolver](/resolvers/public).

## Interacting with a resolver

Depending on the resolver in charge of a name, certain frontend apps will be able to interact with them as well.
This means you can set your favourite records, upgrade your name to different logic, and more, from your dApp of choice.

Are you writing a dApp and want to build this? Checkout the [Interacting with a Resolver](/resolvers/interacting) section.

## Offchain Resolution

Although by default ENS resolution is done on-chain. You can leverage the power of CCIP Read to redirect resolution to an off-chain gateway.
More about writing a CCIP Read-enabled resolver [here](/resolvers/ccip-read).

---

# Public Resolver

The public resolver is a general-purpose ENS resolver that is suitable for most user needs.
It permits the owner of a name to update their records, includes permissions, and stores its data on layer-1 ethereum.

Most ENS names registered through the ENS Manager will use the latest version of the public resolver by default.
Names that resolve to a supported public resolver are editable from within the ENS Manager.

If you'd like to take a peek under the hood you can view the [public resolver source code](https://github.com/ensdomains/ens-contracts/blob/staging/contracts/resolvers/PublicResolver.sol) on GitHub.

## Features

The public resolver supports the following features:

- [EIP-137](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-137) - Contract address interface (`addr()`)
- [EIP-165](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-165) - Interface Detection (`supportsInterface()`)
- [EIP-181](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-181) - Reverse Resolution (`name()`)
- [EIP-205](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-205) - ABI Resolution for contracts (`ABI()`)
- [EIP-619](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-619) - SECP256k1 public keys (`pubkey()`)
- [EIP-634](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-634) - Text records (`text()`)
- [EIP-1577](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1577) - Content hash resolution (`contenthash()`)
- [EIP-2304](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2304) - Multicoin support (`addr()`)

:::note
While the `PublicResolver` provides a convenient default implementation. Many
versions & variations may exist, and it is therefore not recommended to
hardcode any addresses. To ensure a safe implementation, always use the
`supportsInterface()` method to check for the existence of a specific
interface. See [Interacting with a Resolver](/resolvers/interacting) for how
to do this.
:::

## Permissions

The public resolver supports the notion of a "owner" and "manager".

---

# Writing a Resolver

Every ENS name has a resolver, which is responsible for resolving information about a name.

Resolvers are a core part of the ENS protocol. They give each name, represented as a ["node"](/resolution/names#namehash), the power to control the resolution process for itself and all of its subnames. Resolvers were originally standardized in [EIP 137](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-137), but have since received a few updates such as [EIP 181](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-181), [EIP 2304](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2304), and [ENSIP-10](/ensip/10).

You can find the latest default resolver implementation, called the Public Resolver, on [GitHub](https://github.com/ensdomains/ens-contracts/blob/mainnet/contracts/resolvers/PublicResolver.sol) and [Etherscan](/learn/deployments).

## Resolver Interface

You can view an extended list of resolver methods [here](/resolvers/interfaces), however a simple interface might look something like this:

```solidity
interface IMyResolver {
    function supportsInterface(bytes4 interfaceId) external view returns (bool);
    function addr(bytes32 node) external view returns (address payable);
    function addr(bytes32 node, uint256 coinType) external view returns (bytes memory);
    function contenthash(bytes32 node) external view returns (bytes memory);
    function text(bytes32 node, string calldata key) external view returns (string memory);

    function setAddr(bytes32 node, address addr) external;
    function setAddr(bytes32 node, uint256 coinType, bytes calldata a) external;
    function setContenthash(bytes32 node, bytes calldata hash) external;
    function setText(bytes32 node, string calldata key, string calldata value) external;
}
```

## Wildcard Resolution

In [ENSIP-10](/ensip/10) a new `resolve()` method was added to the resolver interface to allow for wildcard resolution.

```solidity
interface IExtendedResolver {
    /**
     * @dev Performs ENS name resolution for the supplied name and resolution data.
     * @param name The name to resolve, in normalised and DNS-encoded form.
     * @param data The resolution data, as specified in ENSIP-10.
     * @return The result of resolving the name.
     */
    function resolve(
        bytes memory name,
        bytes memory data
    ) external view returns (bytes memory);
}
```

:::note
Don't forget to add `0x9061b923` to your [EIP-165](https://eips.ethereum.org/) `supportsInterface()` implementation.
:::

## Onchain Resolvers

By default, ENS names use the [Public Resolver](/resolvers/public) which stores all data onchain. An extremely basic resolver that stores a mapping of ENS names to addresses might look like this:

```solidity
contract OnchainResolver {
    mapping(bytes32 node => address addr) public addr;

    function setAddr(bytes32 node, address _addr) external {
        addr[node] = _addr;
    }

    function supportsInterface(
        bytes4 interfaceID
    ) external pure returns (bool) {
        return
            interfaceID == OnchainResolver.supportsInterface.selector ||
            // function addr(bytes32 node) external view returns (address)
            interfaceID == 0x3b3b57de;
    }
}
```

:::note
This is not secure since it doesn't implement any form of access control for updating a name's address, and is only suitable for demonstration purposes.
:::

Since the mapping is stored internally, it costs gas for the owner of a name to update their address. This is great for a maximal decentralization, but is not always practical.

## Offchain Resolvers

An offchain resolver is a resolver that implements CCIP Read to defer a name's resolution to an HTTP server. This server can then load data from any source including offchain databases, APIs, or other blockchains. [Learn more about CCIP Read](/resolvers/ccip-read).

An equivalent offchain resolver to the above onchain example looks something like this:

```solidity
contract OffchainResolver {
    string public url =
        "https://docs.ens.domains/api/example/basic-gateway";

    error OffchainLookup(
        address sender,
        string[] urls,
        bytes callData,
        bytes4 callbackFunction,
        bytes extraData
    );

    function addr(bytes32 node) external view returns (address) {
        bytes memory callData = abi.encodeWithSelector(
            OffchainResolver.addr.selector,
            node
        );

        string[] memory urls = new string[](1);
        urls[0] = url;

        revert OffchainLookup(
            address(this),
            urls,
            callData,
            OffchainResolver.addrCallback.selector,
            abi.encode(callData, address(this))
        );
    }

    function addrCallback(
        bytes calldata response,
        bytes calldata
    ) external pure returns (address) {
        address _addr = abi.decode(response, (address));
        return _addr;
    }

    function supportsInterface(
        bytes4 interfaceID
    ) external pure returns (bool) {
        return
            interfaceID == OffchainResolver.supportsInterface.selector ||
            interfaceID == OffchainResolver.addr.selector;
    }
}
```

:::note
This is not secure since it doesn't implement any form of verification in the callback function, and is only suitable for demonstration purposes.
:::

Any ENS name that sets its resolver to this contract would resolve to whatever address the Gateway returns, which can be changed at any time offchain for free. See the [gateway code here](https://github.com/ensdomains/docs/blob/master/functions/api/example/basic-gateway.ts).

For the same functionality to work with subnames, you'd need to implement the `resolve()` method from ENSIP-10. A feature-complete example can be found [here](https://github.com/ensdomains/ccip-tools/blob/master/contracts/OffchainResolver.sol), and easily deployed via [ccip.tools](https://ccip.tools/).

# Universal Resolver [A swiss army knife for resolution.]

## Overview

The Universal Resolver is a contract that handles the work of resolving a name entirely onchain, making it possible to make a single smart contract call to resolve an ENS name.

Note that this contract is already built into libraries like [viem](https://viem.sh) and [ENSjs](https://github.com/ensdomains/ensjs), so most developers don't typically need to use it directly.

### Forward Resolution

To resolve one or more records for a name, use one of the `resolve` methods, such as `resolve(bytes name, bytes data)`.

The `name` argument for these methods will be the [DNS-encoded](/resolution/names#dns) version of the name. Make sure to [normalize](/resolution/names#normalize) the name first, as well! For example, given the name `My.Name.eth`:

1. Normalize:
   - `My.Name.eth` -> `my.name.eth`
2. DNS Encode:
   - `my.name.eth` -> `0x026d79046e616d650365746800`

The `data` argument for these methods will be an ABI-encoded call to the resolver for that name.

For example, if you want to resolve the ETH address for `my.name.eth`, using the `addr(bytes32 node)` method, then the corresponding ABI-encoded call would be:

```
0x3b3b57def61adbd8ee36cf930560efc644af752731733dc6421afe47608f8e2cfeaabe2b
```

See here for standard resolver methods: [Resolver Interface Standards](/resolvers/interfaces)

### Reverse Resolution

To reverse-resolve an address to an ENS name, call one of the `reverse` methods, such as `reverse(bytes reverseName)`.

The `reverseName` argument for these methods will be the [DNS-encoded](/resolution/names#dns) version of the reverse name. The "reverse name" is `[addr].addr.reverse`, where `[addr]` is the lowercased Ethereum public address without the "0x". Make sure to [normalize](/resolution/names#normalize) the name as well! For example, given the address `0x231b0Ee14048e9dCcD1d247744d114a4EB5E8E63`:

1. Construct Reverse Name:
   ```
   0x231b0Ee14048e9dCcD1d247744d114a4EB5E8E63 ->
   231b0Ee14048e9dCcD1d247744d114a4EB5E8E63.addr.reverse
   ```
2. Normalize:
   ```
   231b0Ee14048e9dCcD1d247744d114a4EB5E8E63.addr.reverse ->
   231b0ee14048e9dccd1d247744d114a4eb5e8e63.addr.reverse
   ```
3. DNS Encode:
   ```
   231b0ee14048e9dccd1d247744d114a4eb5e8e63.addr.reverse ->
   0x28323331623065653134303438653964636364316432343737343464313134613465623565386536330461646472077265766572736500

# Offchain / L2 Resolvers

The source of truth for a name and its subdomains does not always have to be onchain or on Ethereum L1 at all. By leveraging [EIP-3668](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3668) (CCIP Read) in a [Resolver](/resolvers/quickstart), developers can effectively defer resolution to an L2 or offchain API.

## How does CCIP Read work?

CCIP Read (Cross Chain Interoperability Protocol) is a specification that defines a standard error smart contracts can throw if they want to trigger an offchain HTTP request.

```solidity
error OffchainLookup(
    address sender,
    string[] urls,
    bytes callData,
    bytes4 callbackFunction,
    bytes extraData
)
```

When a contract reverts with the `OffchainLookup` error, it is up to clients (wagmi, viem, ethers, etc.) to handle it appropriatrely. Thankfully, many clients support CCIP Read out of the box so it's transparent to application developers in most cases.

### How does ENS use CCIP Read?

CCIP Read can be used to make ENS name resolution more flexible. Instead of storing all data on Ethereum L1, developers can [implement CCIP Read in a Resolver](/resolvers/writing#offchain-resolvers) to store data (subnames, records, etc.) on L2 networks or even an offchain database.

![](/img/ccip-read-diagram-1.png)

To resolve an offchain/L2 name using CCIP Read, the steps are as follows:

1. A user types "example.eth" into their wallet.
2. The wallet's client calls `resolve()` on example.eth's Resolver.
3. The Resolver reverts with an `OffchainLookup` error.
4. The client makes a request to the gateway URL specified in the error with the calldata from the error.
5. The gateway processes the request and returns data to the client. This is where the data is fetched from L2 or an offchain database.
6. The client calls the callback function specified in the error with the data returned from the gateway, which usually performs some sort of validation.
7. If the callback function validates the data, the client returns the result to the user.

While this might sound complex, it all happens under the hood and is completely transparent to application developers.

## Offchain Subname Example

An example of offchain ENS names powered by CCIP Read can be found at [offchain.ens.gregskril.com](https://offchain.ens.gregskril.com/).
The name [offchaindemo.eth](https://ens.app/offchaindemo.eth) with Resolver [0x35b9...E237](https://etherscan.io/address/0x35b920d4329C5797727Af8b15358b43509e5E237#code), reverts with `OffchainLookup` and directs the client to a Gateway URL.

The Gateway returns the relevant information from an offchain database, signed by a trusted private key which the smart contract can verify. This prevents a compromised Gateway from returning false information.

<Repository
  src="gskril/ens-offchain-registrar"
  description="Offchain ENS Subnames"
/>

## Offchain vs L2 Resolvers

From the perspective of the L1 Resolver contract, the process of resolving an L2 name is exactly the same as resolving on offchain name. The differences come from the Gateway implementation and the Resolver's callback function.

For names that are stored offchain like the example above, the Gateway would read from a normal web2 database and the Resolver's callback function would simply verify the Gateway operator's signature.

For names that are stored on L2, the Gateway would make an RPC call to the relevant L2 and the Resolver's callback function would ideally verify the response by using the L2's state roon on L1 (this assumes knowledge of how L2's work).

To implement trustless L2 resolution, developers should use a solution like [Unruggable Gateways](https://gateway-docs.unruggable.com/).

<Repository
  src="unruggable-labs/unruggable-gateways"
  description="Solution for fetching proofs of data from rollup chains and verifying that data on Layer 1 Ethereum."
/>

## Writing a CCIP Read Gateway

A gateway is an offchain API endpoint that implements the [Gateway Interface](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3668#gateway-interface) specified in EIP-3668. It is responsible for decoding the calldata from an `OffchainLookup` error and returning a relevant response.

### Implementing the Endpoint

Your gateway must implement either a `GET` or `POST` endpoint with `{sender}` and `{data}` parameters, and be stored in the implementing smart contract. The `OffchainLookup` error will include this URL, which is how the client knows where to send the request.

:::code-group

```yaml [POST]
// POST if URL does not include '{data}' parameter
URL: https://example.com/gateway
Method: POST
Body:
  sender: "0x..."
  data: "0x..."
```

```yaml [GET]
// GET if URL includes '{data}' parameter
URL: https://example.com/gateway/{sender}/{data}.json
Method: GET
```

:::

<Properties>
  <Properties.Property name="sender" type="address">
    Lowercased address of the contract reverting with the `OffchainLookup`
    error.
  </Properties.Property>
  <Properties.Property name="data" type="bytes">
    0x prefixed bytes of the data passed to the `OffchainLookup` error.
  </Properties.Property>
</Properties>

### Example Gateway Implementation

The most basic gateway implementation is to return a static value without doing any signing. We even have a library [@ensdomains/ccip-read-router](http://github.com/ensdomains/ccip-read-router) to abstract decoding the calldata.

<EmbedLink
  title="Basic Gateway Implementation"
  href="https://github.com/ensdomains/docs/blob/master/functions/api/example/basic-gateway.ts"
/>

### Trust Assumptions

As explained in [Offchain vs L2 Resolvers](#offchain-vs-l2-resolvers), trust assumptions are up to the implementing developer and can range from fully trusted to full trustless.

The worst case scenario of a trusted implementation is that a malicious actor gains control of the gateway and can return false information.

The worst case scenario of a trustless implementation is that a malicious actor can take a gateway offline, but it can never return false data.

## Writing an Offchain/L2 Resolver

See [Writing a Resolver](/resolvers/writing#offchain-resolvers) for more information on how to implement a Resolver with CCIP Read.

## Testing your offchain names

To test your implementation, search the relevant name in the [ENS Manager App](https://app.ens.domains). Make sure that you've configured your test name to return a result for common data like an ETH address or common text records like `avatar` or `description`. If you set an arbitrary text record key like `test`, the manager app has no way of knowing that it exists.

---

# Interacting with a Resolver [Set Addresses, Text Records, and more]

Some apps may want to allow for users to edit, update, or modify their name and its behaviour at a more advanced level.
This is possible by interacting with the resolver contract of a name directly.

## Checking Interface Support

Before you start sending transactions to users resolvers, you should check if they support the interface you want to use. This is done by calling the `supportsInterface` (see [EIP-165](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-165)) function on the resolver contract.

```solidity
function supportsInterface(bytes4 interfaceID) external pure returns (bool)
```

In order to ensure that resolvers we interact with are compatible with specific standards you can call the above function on contracts with an interfaceID and then check the boolean it returns.

Interface IDs are calculated according to solidity ABI and stored in a four-byte value.

## Updating a user's Record

If you want to help a user set their avatar, specify a preferred color scheme, or set any other record on their ENS name you can do so in specific cases.

First we need to <b>check if the user's resolver supports the interface</b> we want to use (see [setText](/resolvers/interfaces#0x10f13a8c)).
Afterwhich you can call the `setText()` function on the user's resolver contract.

:::code-group

```solidity [Solidity]
interface Resolver {
    function setText(bytes32 node, string calldata key, string calldata value) external;
}
```

```typescript [ENSjs]
// https://github.com/ensdomains/ensjs/blob/main/docs/wallet/function.setRecords.md
import { addEnsContracts } from '@ensdomains/ensjs'
import { setRecords } from '@ensdomains/ensjs/wallet'
import { createWalletClient, custom } from 'viem'
import { mainnet } from 'viem/chains'

const wallet = createWalletClient({
  chain: addEnsContracts(mainnet),
  transport: custom(window.ethereum),
})
const hash = await setRecords(wallet, {
  name: 'ens.eth',
  coins: [
    {
      coin: 'ETH',
      value: '0xFe89cc7aBB2C4183683ab71653C4cdc9B02D44b7',
    },
  ],
  texts: [{ key: 'foo', value: 'bar' }],
  resolverAddress: '0x4976fb03C32e5B8cfe2b6cCB31c09Ba78EBaBa41',
})
// 0x...

Please make it clear to the user what you are doing and why. If possible please also showcase the record you are setting to the user before you do so.

## Update a user's Resolver

Overwriting a user's resolver involves overwriting the behaviour of their ENS name.

In order to overwrite the resolver for a user you need to call the `setResolver` function on the `ENSRegistry` contract.

:::code-group

```solidity [Solidity]
interface ENS {
    function setResolver(bytes32 node, address resolver) external;
}
```

```typescript [ENSjs]
// https://github.com/ensdomains/ensjs/blob/main/docs/wallet/function.setResolver.md
import { addEnsContracts } from '@ensdomains/ensjs'
import { setResolver } from '@ensdomains/ensjs/wallet'
import { createWalletClient, custom } from 'viem'
import { mainnet } from 'viem/chains'

const wallet = createWalletClient({
  chain: addEnsContracts(mainnet),
  transport: custom(window.ethereum),
})
const hash = await setResolver(wallet, {
  name: 'ens.eth',
  contract: 'registry',
  resolverAddress: '0x4976fb03C32e5B8cfe2b6cCB31c09Ba78EBaBa41',
})
// 0x...
```

:::

Please do not change the resolver for a user without their permission. Overwriting the resolver is a destructive action and will overwrite any existing resolution logic.

## Layer 2 & Offchain Resolvers

At the time of writing this the ecosystem around multichain and "writing" to layer 2 & offchain resolvers has yet to be standardized and is still under active development.
Please check back at a later date.

# Supported TLD List [Any DNS TLD that supports DNSSEC can be used with ENS]

Alongside the `.eth` Top Level Domain, the ENS Protocol also supports most of your favourite DNS Top Level Domains (such as `.com`, `.cash` or `.domains`).

All DNS TLDs are owned by the [DNS Registrar](/registry/dns) by default, but TLD operators can claim ownership of their TLD in ENS to implement custom logic.

Below is a list of all known custom TLD implementations:

{/* TODO: Generate this at build time */}

## Abstract

We propose that 200k ENS (\~3.7% of the [unclaimed airdrop](https://twitter.com/ensdomains/status/1522066354387718144)) be allocated in recognition of past and ongoing work of these core contributors.

ENS is one of the most successful projects built on Ethereum, and yet core protocol contributors do not benefit in any way from the success of projects being built on Ethereum. The Protocol Guild provides a vehicle for the ENS community to distribute governance tokens to those individuals who build and maintain the foundational infrastructure that ENS relies on.

ENS sponsorship of the Guild allows members to engage with ENS in a way that is values- and incentive-aligned. Simultaneously, it will allow them to continue the important work of scaling our shared infrastructure and making it as resilient as possible for the applications on top of it.

### Context

1. As a credibly neutral, maximally uncapturable infrastructure with no block reward, the Ethereum base protocol doesn't offer the same token incentives to contributors as applications or L2s can. However, the protocol still needs to attract and retain talent to continue to evolve. As the broader ecosystem continues to grow, competition for talented individuals will only increase. This isn't to fault individuals for rationally weighting financial incentives, or protocols for leveraging the power of tokens - this is just the reality of the current context. We also acknowledge that financial motivations aren't the only or best motivator for people, it's just one tool in our toolset that is currently underleveraged.
2. Existing public goods funding solutions tend to be either too narrow or broad in scope, fail to exclusively target core protocol contributors, or depend on an intermediating institution, which often leads to organizations, and not individuals, being recipients of funds.
3. The Protocol benefits from contributor continuity. Transferring institutional knowledge between cohorts is more likely to happen successfully the more overlap there is.

Here's a longer exploration of the [project rationale](https://protocol-guild.readthedocs.io/en/latest/1-proposal-rationale.html).

If we believe what we are building is important, then we should structure the incentives to attract more smart people to work on it. After all, "Ethereum is an unprecedented arena for playing cooperative games"; we should try to manifest the novel possibilities made possible by this arena. ([Griffith, 2019](https://medium.com/@virgilgr/ethereum-is-game-changing-technology-literally-d67e01a01cf8))

### What is the Protocol Guild?

The Protocol Guild aims to address the challenges mentioned above with a simple tool: a weighted split contract that includes vesting. Members will solicit sponsorships in the form of tokens from applications & protocols that build on Ethereum, which gives core contributors exposure to success at the application layer:

- current contributors are rewarded for past work through time-based weighting
- current contributors contribute for longer periods, resulting in less contributor churn
- new contributors are incentivized to join core protocol work, protocol evolution and maintenance is more robust

To date, the membership includes over 110 Ethereum protocol contributors, including researchers, client maintainers, upgrade coordinators, and more, all self-curated (member list [here](https://protocol-guild.readthedocs.io/en/latest/9-membership.html)). This is a broad-based ecosystem effort: members come from 22 different teams and 9 organizations. Only 30% of members are directly employed by the EF. The membership is continuously curated through quarterly updates to the split contract - we expect the membership to grow to 150 over the course of the Pilot.

The Guild contracts will act as an autonomous value routing mechanism, operated independently from any existing institution, purpose-built for incentivizing long-term core protocol work. At no point does PG take custody of funds on behalf of members, it is all handled trustlessly. The diagram below and the [docs](https://protocol-guild.readthedocs.io/en/latest/3-smart-contract.html) have more information.

![](/content/dao/proposals/1.9-1.png)

### 2022 Pilot

Since starting the project in Nov 2021, we've built norms around member onboarding , refined the splitting and vesting mechanisms, and created extensive documentation on how PG operates.

At this point, we're ready to test the mechanism's efficacy with a 1 year / $10-20mm Pilot. We want to make sure the mechanism operates smoothly before graduating to a full-scale fundraising round for longer vesting periods. The funds for the Pilot would be vested directly to Guild members over one year: see the [Pilot vesting contract here](https://app.0xsplits.xyz/accounts/0xF29Ff96aaEa6C9A1fBa851f74737f3c069d4f1a9/).

### Proposal

We are proposing that 200k ENS (\~3.7% of the [unclaimed airdrop](https://twitter.com/ensdomains/status/1522066354387718144)) be sent to the [Pilot vesting contract](https://app.0xsplits.xyz/accounts/0xF29Ff96aaEa6C9A1fBa851f74737f3c069d4f1a9/) deployed at 0xF29…f1a9 in recognition of the past and ongoing work of these core contributors.

The tokens would not be liquidated, but would vest for one year to each beneficiary listed on the underlying split. Each recipient would be making an independent decision about how to use their tokens once vested.

The USD value of the 200k ENS is $2.49mm as of the time of this post on May 25 2022. This is roughly in line with what we have already proposed to similarly prominent Ethereum-based protocols. [Lido's 2mm LDO contribution](https://research.lido.fi/t/proposal-to-fund-the-protocol-guild-pilot-via-a-lido-grant/2016) was worth $2.6mm; the [active Uniswap proposal](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/governance-proposal-should-the-uniswap-community-participate-in-the-protocol-guild-pilot/16824) requesting 500k UNI would be worth $2.75mm.

There are a few reasons why supporting the Protocol Guild benefits the ENS community:

- ENS's long-term success is tightly coupled with the continued evolution and maintenance of the Ethereum protocol. These are projects that often have multi-year timelines. Contributing to the Pilot meaningfully increases the incentive to contribute to the core protocol, including:
  - [The Merge](https://github.com/ethereum/pm/blob/master/Merge/mainnet-readiness.md): moving from PoW to PoS, increasing security and sustainability
  - EVM improvements: new functionality for developers like [EOF](https://notes.ethereum.org/@ipsilon/evm-object-format-overview)
  - [Statelessness](https://notes.ethereum.org/@gballet/Sy-a6T5St): sustainable management for state growth
  - Supporting L2 scaling: [EIP-4844](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4844), [EIP-4488](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4488)
  - [Proposer Builder Separation](https://notes.ethereum.org/@vbuterin/pbs_censorship_resistance): reducing centralizing incentives for consensus participants
  - Continuous client maintenance: improving sync, exploring new database types, researching modular clients
  - Coordinating network upgrades: making sure the community helps to shape and is aware of network upgrades
- Having exposure to ENS allows protocol contributors to engage more with ENS governance. Members will be encouraged (but not obligated) to delegate them within the ENS governance framework.
- ENS should be among the protocols maximally aligned with the Public Goods of the largest ecosystem it operates in. Pilot participation maintains and expands the ENS community's existing reputation for funding Public Goods.
- Diverse funding sources from the community further decentralizes protocol governance and prevents influence from pooling with any single entity.

We hope that a successful Pilot will pave the way for future funding collaborations between the ENS community and the Protocol Guild as we scale up the project after the Pilot. To that end, we think it's important to demonstrate impact: learn more about how we intend to evaluate [Pilot outcomes here](https://protocol-guild.readthedocs.io/en/latest/5-initial-pilot.html). We have also adopted an active stance of continuous adjustments to improve PG while we operate the Pilot: improving documentation, resources for members, better transparency, etc.

_Note: This was previously numbered EP7.4._

## Summary

The Ecosystem WG is requesting funding to start the Q1/Q2 2022 term. The initial request is made up of three components:

1. Elected steward compensation: $12,000 in cDAI
2. Bounties for ENS Public Goods Request for Proposals program: $50,000 in cDAI
3. Operational Budget $38,000 in cDAI

**Total for Q1 & Q2: $150,000.00 in cDAI**

The group will be using the price of cDAI in uniswap to calculate the exact amounts requested. We are using cDAI as a accounting unit as a manner to provide a stable value that will still accrue value while not in utilization and resist dollar depreciation. The group can convert them in DAI when sending out payments and grants. The current price of cDAI orbits around 0.021-0.022 per dai and the total budget would be, in today's value, about 6.85M cDAI.

**Elected steward compensation**

The group has 5 elected stewards: Alex (avsa.eth), makoto.eth, sumedha.eth, Scott and Richard Moore (Ricmoo.eth). Two of these steward are appointed by True Names and will not be receiving compensation, and one of the other stewards has elected to forego compensation and therefore we will asking only for a total of 12k USD for the total Steward Compensation. Pay for past months will be sent immediately and the remaining will be streamed until june 30th.

**Bounties for ENS Public Goods Request for Proposals program:**

The bounties will be distributed in prizes of $1,000, $5,000, and $10,000 for projects that execute on basic implementation of goals elected by the stewards. These are set to be given directly to projects and not spent on operations. Any funds remaining at the end of the term will be either given back to the DAO or rolled in the Public Goods stewards budget for the next term.

**Operational Budget**

These will encompass tasks like reimbursements for expenses executed by stewards, payment for projects like a website, social media, or compensation for work done in partner integrations. All payments must be approved by at least 3 other stewards and will be executed in the most transparent manner the stewards can find.

## Abstract

This proposal executes a swap of 10,000 ETH into USDC, to ensure ENS DAO has enough to cover operating expenses for 18 - 24 months.

## Motivation

The DAO currently keeps almost 100% of its spendable treasury in ETH. While ENS generates protocol revenue in ETH, having so much exposure to a single volatile asset places the DAO in a vulnerable position.

This is a proposal to convert 10,000 ETH into USDC through a Cowswap swap.

10,000 ETH is approximately 25% of the total amount of ETH held by the ENS DAO (wallet.ensdao.eth) and register controller (controller.ens.eth) as of January 18, 2023.

It is hoped that this sale will generate in excess of $13m in USDC. The goal is to ensure that the DAO has enough USDC to cover operations for the next 18 - 24 months.

## Specification

1. Call `withdraw()` on controller.ens.eth (0x283af0b28c62c092c9727f1ee09c02ca627eb7f5)
2. Call `deposit()` on WETH9 (0xc02aaa39b223fe8d0a0e5c4f27ead9083c756cc2), sending 10,000 ETH
3. Call `approve(<milkman>, 10000 ETH)` on WETH9 (0xc02aaa39b223fe8d0a0e5c4f27ead9083c756cc2)
4. Call `requestSwapExactTokensForTokens(10000 ETH, <WETH9>, <USDC>, wallet.ensdao.eth, <uniswap v3 price checker>, <price checker data>)` on milkman (0x11C76AD590ABDFFCD980afEC9ad951B160F02797)

Price checker data is configured to check the swap against the Uniswap v3 pool and limit to 2% slippage. It is generated using the below code:

```javascript
import { ethers } from 'https://cdn.ethers.io/lib/ethers-5.2.esm.min.js'

function getCheckerData(slippage, path, fees) {
  return ethers.utils.defaultAbiCoder.encode(
    ['uint256', 'bytes'],
    [
      slippage,
      ethers.utils.defaultAbiCoder.encode(
        ['address[]', 'uint24[]'],
        [path, fees]
      ),
    ]
  )
}

const checkerData = getCheckerData(
  200,
  [
    '0xC02aaA39b223FE8D0A0e5C4F27eAD9083C756Cc2',
    '0xA0b86991c6218b36c1d19D4a2e9Eb0cE3606eB48',

## Abstract

With the new Name Wrapper, we will add a new .eth controller that allows registering wrapped names directly as well as registering with multiple records and adding a reverse record in 1 transaction. This will reduce the transactions required from 4 to 2 (for adding records + reverse). This will be added as a controller to the NameWrapper, and the NameWrapper will be added as the new controller of the existing .eth Base Registrar.

We will also replace the current reverse registrar with a new reverse registrar which allows the new controller to set the reverse on registration, as well as adds support for the owner of contract to retrospectively claim their reverse node.

## Specification

New instances of the Name Wrapper, Reverse Registrar, and .eth registrar controller have been deployed to mainnet at these addresses:

- NameWrapper: `0xD4416b13d2b3a9aBae7AcD5D6C2BbDBE25686401`
- ReverseRegistrar: `0xa58E81fe9b61B5c3fE2AFD33CF304c454AbFc7Cb`
- ETHRegistrarController: `0x253553366Da8546fC250F225fe3d25d0C782303b`
- PublicResolver: `0x231b0Ee14048e9dCcD1d247744d114a4EB5E8E63`

They have been configured, and ownership has been transferred to the DAO.The new Public Resolver is set as the default resolver on the reverse registrar.

This executable proposal will execute the following calls to complete the contract upgrades:

1. Call `registrar.addController(newNameWrapperAddress)`
2. Call `ens.setSubnodeOwner(namehash('reverse'), labelhash('addr'), newReverseRegistrarAddress)`
3. Call `setInterface` on the resolver for .eth with the interface IDs and contract addresses of the new .eth registrar controller and namewrapper. This is used as part of the discovery mechanism by the ENS manager app and others in order to locate the new contracts.

## Summary

Transfer ENS treasury and contract ownership from the ENS Multisig to ENS DAO.

## Abstract

With the recent launch of the ENS DAO and $ENS token, it is now time for key governance powers of ENS to be transferred from the ENS root multisig to the ENS DAO.

🔥_🔥 ([Fire Eyes DAO](https://fireeyes.xyz)) has taken a [central role in the planning and execution](https://mirror.xyz/james.eth/XkOIGh8xu_bF2cQV4QZkKxoN0o1OuNoEb3o-Nzjdo3I) of ENS's decentralization journey and is excited to present this first proposal to the community.

This proposal will take a different form than normal as it proposes making a request to the ENS multisig root keyholders, rather than executing an action on the DAO.

**This proposal looks to execute a transfer of ownership of several aspects of the protocol which are currently controlled by the ENS root multisig:**

1. We propose that control over the existing ENS treasury is transferred to the DAO.
2. We propose that ownership of the ENS Registrar Controller and the pricing oracle is transferred to the DAO.

   Ownership of the price oracle gives the DAO the ability to:

   1. Set the contract used to get the USD-ETH price.\*
   2. Change the price per year of each length of domain name.

   Ownership of the registrar controller gives the DAO the ability to:

   1. Replace the price oracle contract.
   2. Withdraw accumulated funds to the DAO treasury.
   3. Set the minimum and maximum period between the first and second transactions of the registration process.

3. We propose that ownership of the ENS Registrar is transferred to the DAO. Ownership of the .eth registrar gives the DAO the ability to:

   1. Add and remove controller contracts.
   2. Set the resolver contract for .eth

4. We propose that ownership of the 'reverse' namespace, which governs assignment of primary ENS records, be transferred to the DAO. Ownership of the .reverse TLD gives the DAO the ability to:
   1. Replace the reverse registrar for Ethereum addresses.
   2. Create new types of reverse resolution (For example, bitcoin addresses) and update them.

Importantly, control over the ENS root will remain with the ENS root multisig for now. Control over the root allows for the creation and replacement of ENS top-level domains (TLDs) other than .eth (.eth is locked and cannot be changed by the root). This proposal also does not transfer ownership of the DNSSEC registrar contract, necessary for administering the DNSSEC integration used to allow owners of DNS domains to claim them on ENS.

Powers over the ENS root are not being requested immediately, as they are both powers that can be abused to revoke or reassign non-.eth ENS names, and as such the risk to name owners is significantly higher than the other powers the DAO will exercise. Once the DAO has demonstrated its ability to successfully govern ENS, a future proposal will transfer these powers to the DAO.

Snapshot voting on the above proposals will be conducted individually via approval voting; any proposal above that gets at least 50% approval and a quorum of 1% becomes the official policy of the DAO.

## Specification

The ENS DAO formally petitions the ENS root keyholders (being the owners of the multisig located at multisig.ens.eth) to execute a transaction or transactions taking the following actions:

1. If proposal 1 passes, transfer all ETH and USDC held by multisig.ens.eth to the DAO's timelock contract at wallet.ensdao.eth.
2. If proposal 2 passes, call `transferOwnership` on the contracts at controller.ens.eth and 0xb9d374d0fe3d8341155663fae31b7beae0ae233a (the price oracle), passing in the address of wallet.ensdao.eth.
3. If proposal 3 passes, call `transferOwnership` on the contract at registrar.ens.eth, passing in the address of wallet.ensdao.eth.
4. If proposal 4 passes, call `setSubnodeOwner` on the root, passing in `keccak256('reverse')` and the address of wallet.ensdao.eth.

The ENS DAO agrees to use these funds and powers in accordance with the ENS Constitution.

## Conclusion & Next Steps

This proposal looks to set precedent as the first action taken by ENS delegates & token holders. Upon successful execution, the ENS DAO will hold control over two significant aspects of the protocol, and will be able to dispense funds effectively towards community initiatives.

- Discuss this proposal on the ENS forum and discord.
- Implement a vote on this proposal on Snapshot.
- If passed:
  - Transfer existing assets from the ENS Community multisig to the ENS DAO.
  - Transfer control over the Registrar Controller to the ENS DAO.

This vote is being conducted via approval voting; select each option you wish to see pass. Those options that have at least 50% support and 1% quorum when voting ends will pass

## Summary

This executable proposal seeks to implement the reimbursement payment to ENS Labs for the legal fees incurred while pursuing litigation to protect the eth.link domain. The reimbursement was approved in the previously passed social proposal [EP 5.3](./5.3).

## Background

The lawsuit that ENS filed in federal district court in Arizona to maintain ownership and control over eth.link has been resolved, and on 26 August 2024, the Court officially closed this case.

ENS Labs has maintained full ownership and control over the eth.link domain and, therefore, ENS Labs has achieved the initial objective they had when first filing the complaint and obtaining injunctive relief. To reach this outcome, ENS Labs has spent in total 1,218,669.76 USD. This legal action was necessary to defend the ENS ecosystem and maintain control of the eth.link domain, a critical infrastructure component since 2017.

- [Forum Discussion on EP 5.3](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/ep5-2-social-determine-ens-labs-next-steps-in-eth-link-litigation/18756)

## Specification

This executable proposal will initiate a transfer of 1,218,669.76 USDC from the ENS DAO treasury to ENS Labs. This amount represents the final total of all legal expenses related to the eth.link litigation.

### Transaction Details

- **From:** ENS DAO Treasury (0xFe89cc7aBB2C4183683ab71653C4cdc9B02D44b7)
- **To:** USDC Token Contract (0xA0b86991c6218b36c1d19D4a2e9Eb0cE3606eB48)
- **Recipient:** ENS Labs (0x690F0581eCecCf8389c223170778cD9D029606F2)
- **Amount:** 1,218,669.76 USDC (1218669760000 considering USDC's 6 decimal places)
- **Purpose:** Reimbursement for legal fees in eth.link litigation

This transaction calls the `transfer` function of the USDC contract, transferring 1,218,669.76 USDC to ENS Labs' address.

## Rationale

The ENS community, through the passage of EP 5.3, has demonstrated its support for reimbursing ENS Labs for the legal expenses incurred in protecting the eth.link domain. This reimbursement acknowledges the efforts made by ENS Labs to safeguard a critical asset of the ENS ecosystem. It ensures that the financial burden of this legal action does not fall solely on ENS Labs, particularly given that their actions were taken to benefit the entire ENS community.

_Note - When the original snapshot for the social vote was posted it was numbered as 5.2, but it should have been 5.3. It has been renumbered in the official ENS documentation. Some links point to forum discussions and Snapshots that show the original duplicitive label of 5.2_

## Summary

This proposal aims to expand the Endowment by funding a third tranche, comprising 5,000 ETH, from the ENS DAO to the ENS Endowment.

Alongside the third tranche transfer, an update to the Allowance Module on the ENS Endowment is proposed; _resetTime_ for ETH allowance (for fee payment) is to be changed from the current parameter of 43,200 seconds (30 days) to 36,000 seconds (25 days). The motivation for this is that there has been an accumulation of payment delays, such that current fee payments are delayed.

## Motivation

Since the establishment of the Endowment on March 7th, 2023, ENS has been setting the gold standard for DAO treasury management:

- **Asset allocation:** ENS has the 6th-largest stablecoin holding and 5th-largest majors (BTC, ETH) holdings of any Protocols ([source](https://defillama.com/treasuries)).
- **Income generation:** Since its inception, the Endowment has generated $2.92M in DeFi results (net of fees) for ENS. In 2024, DeFi results represented 12% of total revenue for ENS according to [ENS Revenue Report: Q3 2024](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/ens-revenue-report-q3-2024/19718). This is on track towards the core goal of self-sufficiency.
- **Asset location:** As of October 31, 2024, 71% of the funds were held in the Endowment, while the remaining 25% were held idle across DAO wallet and Registrar Controllers ([source](https://dune.com/karpatkey/ens-dao-fundflow)).

The original Request for Proposal in [[EP2.2.4]](https://docs.ens.domains/dao/proposals/2.2.4) sets out that the Endowment should be established gradually over time, in response to changing conditions and needs, and to achieve the eventual goal of self-sufficiency. To deliver on this vision for self-sufficiency, a further increase in the Endowment’s returns is needed. As the Endowment is fully utilised within the bounds of the existing mandate, it is clear that those additional returns must come from additional funds.. We think **now** is the right time to implement these increases, given the following developments:

- **Proven track record**: the Endowment has been operating for 1 year and 7 months, with _no funds lost._ During that time, the ENS community has gained familiarity with the Endowment in terms of both operations and infrastructure.
- **Investment Policy Statement as guardrails**: the [newly-adopted IPS](https://snapshot.org/#/ens.eth/proposal/0x085a1e40c264ffd44567b6dce889f5943e72cfa8442eaeb81819261a38f0bd0a) provides an additional layer of checks and balances, so that the DAO and its Metagov Working Group can hold the Endowment Manager accountable.
- **Vulnerability fix by @Blockful**: risk of governance takeover by “risk-free value raiders”, who could have taken over the control of the DAO and the Endowment, has been mitigated. The vulnerability has been fixed by the introduction of the [Security Council](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/ens/proposal/42329103797433777309488042029679811802172320979541414683300183273376839219133) and veto.ensdao.eth.

The proposed third tranche would be sized at 5,000 ETH, representing 42.4% of assets held in the Controller and the DAO Wallets (_per_ the pie chart above) It would raise the capital utilisation rate by 10.5 percentage points from the current 70.8% to 81.3%.

### Updates

Karpatkey’s updates for the Endowment can be seen here: [2023 Review](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/karpatkey-2023-review-for-the-ens-endowment/18656), [1H 2024 Review](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/karpatkey-h1-2024-review-for-the-ens-endowment/19394).

Monthly reports on the Endowment can be found on karpatkey’s website ([here](https://reports.karpatkey.com/ens?month=9&year=2024&currency=USD)).

### What’s been done

- **Investment Policy Statement**: karpatkey has created and [formally introduced](https://snapshot.org/#/ens.eth/proposal/0x085a1e40c264ffd44567b6dce889f5943e72cfa8442eaeb81819261a38f0bd0a) an [Investment Policy Statement](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zsV0k3J7s2QAJUoWxPnBpF6XAGW1HuD6/view) which defines the key roles, responsibilities and limitations of the Endowment and its Manager.
- **Risk Management Development**: karpatkey has designed and implemented a robust risk management stack, leveraging on dedicated risk data service providers, including [Hypernative](https://www.hypernative.io/) and [Redefine](https://redefine.net/). Through weekly meetings with Hypernative, karpatkey is continuously fine-tuning risk alerts and management, especially to cover protocol risks. Automatic, real-time risk alerts help mitigate potential risks. Detailed plans for the Endowment’s emergency protocol and war room are in place to assess and react to urgent situations.
- **Infrastructure Development**: karpatkey has worked very closely with Gnosis Guild to develop [and implement](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/ep-5-12-roles-modifier-v2-migration-updates-to-endowment-permissions/19173), Zodiac Roles Modifier v2. As a design partner, karpatkey provided feedback allowing Zodiac Roles Modifier to become more user-friendly and flexible. One notable improvement is permissions updates user interface, enhancing transparency and simplifying audits for the ENS community. A code review was also conducted for permissions update.
- **Permissions Updates**: the Endowment has been undergoing continuous permissions updates, allowing it to stay up-to-date with changing market landscape and protocols ([[EP 4.1](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/ep-4-1-executable-approve-further-actions-and-strategies-for-the-endowment/17406)], [[EP 4.2](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/4-2-executable-fund-the-endowment-second-tranche/17743)], [[EP 4.5](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/ep-4-5-executable-endowment-permissions-to-karpatkey-update-3/18036)], [[EP 5.12](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/ep-5-12-roles-modifier-v2-migration-updates-to-endowment-permissions/19173)], [[EP 5.14](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/ep-5-14-executable-endowment-permissions-to-karpatkey-update-4/19503)]). Independent, thirdparty security review of our Permissions Updates has also been conducted by [Third Guard](https://thirdguard.com/), with the cost covered by karpatkey.
- **Dune Dashboards Development:** a variety of different Dune dashboards have been created to give public visibility over the DAO and the Endowment, and their respective operations. These include: the [DAO governance dashboard](https://dune.com/karpatkey/ens-dao-governance) (by karpatkey), the [fund flow dashboard](https://dune.com/karpatkey/ens-dao-fundflow) (by karpatkey) and the [financial reporting dashboard](https://dune.com/steakhouse/ens-steakhouse) (by Steakhouse)
- **Reporting:** weekly Endowment updates and monthly financial updates are provided during the DAO’s Metagov meetings. Monthly Endowment updates are also available on the karpatkey [website](https://reports.karpatkey.com/ens?month=9&year=2024&currency=USD). Biannual Endowment updates are provided on ENS forum.
- **Partnerships:** karpatkey has negotiated and put in place a protocol fees rebate agreement with Stader Labs.

### Future plans

- **Risk Management**: to further protect the Endowment against potential hacks and exploits in protocols that the Endowment deploys funds in, karpatkey has been developing Guardians and ‘Agile Execution App’, which automatically detect potential exploit events and exit at-risk positions.
- **Permissions Updates**: The Endowment will undergo continuous permissions updates. Immediate priorities include introducing other stablecoins and RWAs, onboarding new liquid staking protocols and keeping the permissions updated with protocol/contract upgrades.
- **Partnerships**: reinforce yields without taking additional risk by formulating partnership deals leveraging karpatkey’s DeFi network.
- **Analysis on Governance Attack:** karpatkey, together with the ENS community, will conduct further research into potential governance attack vectors that could put the Endowment at risk, and present potential solutions to the DAO.

_Note: This was previously numbered EP3._

## Summary

Amend EP2 to include funds accidentally sent back to the $ENS token contract.

## Abstract

A number of users have [accidentally sent](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/proposal-to-correct-ens-transfer-errors-back-to-contract/5989) $ENS tokens back to the token contract. As of December 6, this amounted to some 6,246 tokens in 49 separate transactions.

These funds are held in the same account as is used for new airdrop claims, and on May 4, 2022 when the airdrop expires, the DAO will be able to claim them back to its own account.

[EP2](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/executable-retrospective-airdrop-for-accounts-that-owned-another-accounts-primary-ens-name/6755) sends approximately 200k tokens to users who owned ENS names that were used as primary names but did not already benefit from the 2x multiplier.

This proposal suggests that [EP2](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/executable-retrospective-airdrop-for-accounts-that-owned-another-accounts-primary-ens-name/6755) be amended to include returning the mistakenly sent funds as part of the same airdrop. This minimises overhead, as the DAO will not incur transaction fees or have to set a separate system up, and enables users to get their mistakenly sent funds back promptly.

## Specification

Amend [EP2](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/executable-retrospective-airdrop-for-accounts-that-owned-another-accounts-primary-ens-name/6755) as follows:

> `-This logic is implemented by [this series of BigQuery queries](https://gist.github.com/Arachnid/667178e854945abaecb6dfd3b6c0c279/1182eea3145394181affe4bb799d6b7858f9eb58), and shows that 1,969 accounts meet these criteria but did not qualify for the multiplier under the original criteria. The sum of the tokens these accounts would be entitled to comes to ~213,049 ENS tokens.`&#x20;

## Abstract

In our research, we found that many services wanted to integrate the Sign-In with Ethereum workflow but did not have the ability to add new passwordless authentication methods to their installations.

We also learned that most services already support OpenID Connect, and were open to adding a new Identity Provider that supported the SIWE workflow. By meeting those services where they are today, we can provide a pragmatic stepping stone towards true decentralization, with an upgrade path to direct authentication.

To ensure adherence to the vision, it's critical that we collaborate with the ENS DAO on hosting and maintenance of this identity server, ensuring the identity server's governance ultimately resides with the community, whom we believe will always put users first. This would be the world's first DAO-hosted, transparent identity server.

## Rationale

The ENS service and community would benefit from increased adoption of Sign-In with Ethereum due to the enablement of organizations to use ENS as a core touchpoint for a user's basic identity and information (via ENS profiles).

Additionally, we believe that a community server could be governed by a credibly neutral party that Ethereum users accept as an intermediary. We think a non-profit or DAO are the right structures to help govern such a server, which is why we would like to collaborate with the ENS DAO on hosting and maintenance.

## Specification and Proposal Request

- **Establish a Subgroup in the Ecosystem Working Group: Community Managed Identity Server**
  - **$250,000** allocated from the DAO to the Ecosystem WG to fund this Subgroup.
    - **$75,000** from the allocated budget will be in place for community contributions related to the Subgroup, including grants for development, evangelism, and retroactive rewards for SIWE-related efforts.
    - **$175,000** from the allocated budget will go towards Spruce's maintenance contract (see below). Paid 25% upon execution, and then an additional 25% every 3 months.
  - This Subgroup will support the administration and maintenance of a DAO-run Identity Server for Sign-In with Ethereum. This subgroup will also serve as a support system to help onboard organizations, and evangelize Sign-In with Ethereum to allow users to control their identifiers and use ENS profiles as a base identity.
  - An important part of duties this group will include creating training, onboarding, and maintenance materials for managing the server on a specified cloud account.
  - Additionally, the group will be responsible for providing updates to the broader community on the health of the server.
  - Initial lead: Rocco from Spruce, while continuing to add interested parties to the group for good governance.
- **A 12-month maintenance contract awarded to Spruce for the continuous monitoring, maintaining, and improving of the deployed Identity Server.**
  - Spruce will help host a [`siwe-oidc`](https://github.com/spruceid/siwe-oidc) implementation in a lightweight fashion, using a well-known infrastructure provider ultimately administered by the Subgroup.
    - Spruce will also be responsible for the deployment, and continuous monitoring, maintenance, and improvements on the server throughout the duration of the contract.
  - If the DAO votes to end the contract funding will be returned against the remaining days of the year and we will provide sufficient training for administrators to transfer those duties to a new organization.
  - The server is expected to be live within 60 days of this proposal being accepted, assuming that access to the necessary systems and people is provided on a timely basis.
  - The 1-year contract begins when this proposal is accepted, and there will not be additional setup fees even if there are increased coordination costs to get the service running.

_Note: This was previously numbered EP12._

## Abstract

This is a proposal to repeal the working group rules passed in [EP4](https://docs.ens.domains/v/governance/governance-proposals/ep4-social-proposal-creation-of-foundational-working-groups-and-working-group-rules) and replace those rules with working group rules specified in this proposal for the Second Term of 2022 and all Terms thereafter.

The working group rules specified in this proposal add more details about Steward responsibilities and the management of working group funds, as well as introducing the requirement of each working group to appoint a lead steward.

The specification below also introduces a rule to appoint a new DAO Secretary, responsible for managing working relationships and communications across working groups as well as performing administrative duties for the DAO.

## Specification

### Working Groups Rules

1. Formation of Working Groups
   1. To create a new working group, a social proposal, as defined by the ENS governance documentation (‘Social Proposal’), must be put forward and passed by the DAO.
   2. A Social Proposal to create a new working group must demonstrate that the new working group is needed and the work cannot be undertaken within an existing working group.
2. Dissolution of Working Groups
   1. A working group can be dissolved by passing a Social Proposal requesting the dissolution of a working group or working groups.
   2. If an active proposal is put forward to dissolve a working group, all working group funds, including outgoing payments, within that working group, are to be frozen with immediate effect, pending the outcome of that vote.
   3. Upon the dissolution of a working group, any and all unspent working group funds from that working group, at the time of dissolution, must be immediately returned to the DAO treasury, without delay.
3. Working Group Stewards
   1. Each working group shall be managed by three stewards (hereafter a 'Steward' or 'Stewards').
   2. Stewards will be elected to serve within working groups for a set period of time (hereafter known as a 'Term' or 'Terms').
   3. There are two Terms each calendar year:
      1. The first Term commences at 9am UTC on January 1 each year and ends immediately prior to the commencement of the second Term ('First Term'); and
      2. The second Term commences at 9am UTC on July 1 each year and ends immediately prior to the commencement of the First Term of the following year ('Second Term').
   4. Stewards are responsible for overseeing the operation of working groups in accordance with these rules and the ENS DAO constitution.
   5. The responsibilities of Stewards include, but are not limited to:
      1. Requesting working group funds from the DAO in accordance with these rules;
      2. Approving the creation of sub-groups or workstreams within a working group to undertake work and/or carry out specific projects or tasks;
      3. Dissolving sub-groups or workstreams within a working group;
      4. Using discretion to make working group funds available to sub-groups, workstreams, or contributors within a working group;
      5. Using discretion to disburse working group funds to people and/or projects in accordance with the ENS DAO constitution; and
      6. Acting as keyholders of working group multi-sigs.
4. Steward Eligibility and Nominations
   1. Any individual is eligible to nominate themselves to be a Steward of a working group within the DAO ('Eligible Person' or 'Eligible Persons').
   2. To be eligible to be included in the ballot for First Term elections of a given year, Eligible Persons must nominate themselves between 9am UTC on December 6 and 9am UTC on December 9 ('First Term Nomination Window').
   3. To be eligible to be included in the ballot for Second Term elections of a given year, Eligible Persons must nominate themselves between 9am UTC on June 6 and 9am UTC on June 9 ('Second Term Nomination Window').
   4. An Eligible Person may nominate themselves to become a Steward of a working group or working groups during the First Term Nomination Window or the Second Term Nomination Window (each a 'Nomination Window'), by meeting the requirements set out in a call for nominations posted in the relevant working group category of the ENS governance forum.
   5. An Eligible Person who completes the steps outlined in rule 4.4 above during a Nomination Window and receives 10,000 signed votes to support their nomination will be included in the ballot as a nominee in the election for Stewards that takes place following that Nomination Window ('Nominee').
5. Steward Elections
   1. Elections for working group Stewards for the First Term of a given year will take place by a vote of governance token holders using signed messages and will be open for 120 hours, commencing at 9am UTC on December 10 each year ('First Term Election Window').
   2. Elections for working group Stewards for the Second Term of a given year will take place by a vote of governance token holders using signed messages and will be open for 120 hours, commencing at 9am UTC on June 10 each year ('Second Term Election Window').
   3. The top-ranked Nominees from each working group vote held during a First Term Election Window or a Second Term Election Window (each an 'Election Window'), will fill any available positions for the role of Steward for those working groups for the Term immediately following an Election Window, based on the order in which they are ranked in each working group vote.
   4. A Nominee elected to serve as a Steward may not take up the role of Steward for more than two working groups during a single Term.
6. Delay of Nominations or Elections
   1. In the event that nominations or elections for Stewards take place after a Nomination Window or after an Election Window, the nomination process and/or elections shall take place, as otherwise prescribed in rules 4 and 5 above, as soon as is practicable after the missed Nomination Window or missed Election Window.
   2. In the event that an election takes place outside of an Election Window and after the commencement date of a new Term, outgoing Stewards from the previous Term shall stay in their positions as working group Stewards until immediately prior to 9am UTC the day following the end of the election, which, for the avoidance of doubt, is 120 hours after voting in those elections commenced.
   3. In the event that an election takes place outside of an Election Window and after the commencement date of a new Term, newly elected Stewards will assume the responsibilities of stewardship within working groups at 9am UTC the day following the end of the election, as defined in rule 6.2 above, for the remainder of that Term.
7. Removal and Replacement of Stewards
   1. Stewards may be removed at any time by:
      1. a Social Proposal passed by the DAO; or
      2. a simple indicative majority vote among Stewards of all working groups, with the outcome of that vote communicated in the relevant working group category of the ENS governance forum.
   2. Stewards may step down from their position at any time by communicating their intention to step down in the ENS governance forum.
   3. In the event that a Steward is removed, steps down, or is unable to continue as a Steward, for whatever reason, prior to the end of a Term, a new election must be held to fill any vacant Steward positions, in accordance with rule 6 above.
8. Lead Stewards
   1. Each working group must appoint a lead Steward within the first five days of a Term (hereafter a 'Lead Steward' or 'Lead Stewards').
   2. Only current elected Stewards of a working group are eligible to serve as Lead Stewards within a given working group.
   3. Lead Stewards may be appointed or removed from that role at any time by a simple indicative majority vote among the Stewards of a working group, with the outcome of that vote communicated in the relevant working group category of the ENS governance forum.
   4. In the event that a Lead Steward steps down from the position or is removed as a Lead Steward before the end of a Term in accordance with rule 8.3 above, a new Lead Steward must be appointed within five calendar days.
   5. A Steward who is appointed to serve as a Lead Steward of a working group will remain in that position, as Lead Steward, from the date of appointment until the end of their elected Term as a Steward or until they are removed as a Lead Steward in accordance with rule 8.3 above or until they are removed as a Steward in accordance with rule 7 above.
   6. Lead Stewards are responsible for the operational management and administration of working groups and are expected to provide regular updates to the DAO in the ENS governance forum related to working group progress, achievements, and challenges.
   7. The responsibilities of Lead Stewards include, but are not limited to:
      1. Acting as a representative of a working group;
      2. Managing resource requests from sub-groups, workstreams, and contributors within a working group;
      3. Initiating the disbursement of working group funds on an as-needed basis;

## Abstract

We propose to convert 6,000 ETH into USDC to replenish the USDC reserves in the [DAO's treasury](https://etherscan.io/address/0xfe89cc7abb2c4183683ab71653c4cdc9b02d44b7).

## Motivation

In February 2023, the DAO executed a swap of 10,000 ETH into USDC via [EP 3.3](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/ens/proposal/45461903078948131870051132081249892009497709518413744958551889217805827301425), generating approximately $16.2M in USDC. The rationale at the time was to secure 18–24 months of operational runway.

Over the past 21 months, the USDC reserves have been effectively utilised to fund ENS DAO's operations. However, these reserves have now been fully depleted. To ensure financial stability and effective liquidity management, it is prudent to secure a 12-month runway in the DAO's wallet to cover operating expenses.

We propose ENS convert 6,000 ETH (~$20.4M at $3,200/ETH) to replenish the USDC reserves. These funds will be used to meet ongoing commitments, such as payments to [ENS Labs](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/ep-5-22-ensv2-development-funding-request/19762), and [Service Provider streams](https://docs.ens.domains/dao/proposals/5.2) and DAO Working Groups.

## Specification

The executable proposal will transfer 6,000 ETH from the ENS DAO Wallet to a [new Safe](https://etherscan.io/address/0x02D61347e5c6EA5604f3f814C5b5498421cEBdEB) created solely for the swap of ETH to USDC. The proposal will also sweep the ETH balance in the [Old Registrar Controller ](https://debank.com/profile/0x283af0b28c62c092c9727f1ee09c02ca627eb7f5)to the DAO wallet.

The payload to transfer 6k ETH from the DAO Multisig is available [here](https://gist.github.com/JeronimoHoulin/5e4728d36bf5d2b7ee08b9382f61bf78). Transaction details:

- From: ENS DAO Wallet ([wallet.ensdao.eth](https://etherscan.io/address/0xFe89cc7aBB2C4183683ab71653C4cdc9B02D44b7#multichain-portfolio))
- Token: ETH
- Amount: 6,000
- Recipient: TWAP Safe ([0x02D6...BdEB](https://app.safe.global/home?safe=eth:0x02D61347e5c6EA5604f3f814C5b5498421cEBdEB))

karpatkey has deployed a [new Safe](https://app.safe.global/home?safe=eth:0x02D61347e5c6EA5604f3f814C5b5498421cEBdEB) dedicated solely for TWAPs, with karpatkey and ENS representatives as signers. The Safe has a threshold of 3 signatures and the following signers:

1. DAO Wallet ([wallet.ensdao.eth](https://etherscan.io/address/0xfe89cc7abb2c4183683ab71653c4cdc9b02d44b7))
2. karpatkey's Endowment manager Safe ([0xb423e0f6E7430fa29500c5cC9bd83D28c8BD8978](https://etherscan.io/address/0xb423e0f6E7430fa29500c5cC9bd83D28c8BD8978))
3. ENS Labs' cold wallet ([coldwallet.ens.eth](https://etherscan.io/address/0x690F0581eCecCf8389c223170778cD9D029606F2))
4. Metagov Working Group Safe ([main.mg.wg.ens.eth](https://etherscan.io/address/0x91c32893216dE3eA0a55ABb9851f581d4503d39b))

This allows for the segregation of funds between other ENS-related wallets (e.g. the Endowment Safe). This proposal sends 6,000 ETH to the newly created Safe.

Signers will swap ETH to USDC via Cow's TWAP mechanism.

The rationale behind this framework is that [Cow's TWAP function](https://docs.cow.fi/cow-protocol/reference/contracts/programmatic/twap) is currently not supported by Tally or the Zodiac Roles Modifier (ZRM) permissions. Once TWAP permissions are integrated, ZRM can be onboarded to this Safe, allowing for the removal of the ENS signers.

Safe keyholders will execute the following swaps:

1. 1,000 ETH swap to meet immediate funding needs by the ENS DAO, executed as soon as funds become available.
2. 5,000 ETH swap via a 3-month TWAP, conducted in 90 parts (~55.6 ETH sold per part), with wallet.ensdao.eth as recipient.

The payload to call withdraw() on the Old Registrar Controller, and send the funds to the DAO Multisig, is available [here](https://gist.github.com/JeronimoHoulin/f08e7a5704829df606602e53447569e3).

Transaction details:

- From: Old Registrar Controller (0x283af0b28c62c092c9727f1ee09c02ca627eb7f5)

## Abstract

Season 2 of the Service Provider Program was approved with a $4.5M budget on February 25th of this year. During the Delegate All Hands meeting on April 1st, delegates expressed a desire for more granular voting — not only to approve candidates, but also to vote on individual budget allocations.

In the weeks that followed, extensive discussions took place on how to address this through an amendment. Two main proposals emerged from these discussions, now formally designated as EP6.4 and EP6.5.

## Vote Results

There are now two active proposals to amend the Service Provider Program. Here's how the outcome of this vote should be interpreted:

- If this vote passes but receives fewer votes than EP6.4, then this amendment is considered null.
- If this vote passes and receives more votes than EP6.4, then EP6.4 is considered superseded.
- If this vote fails to reach either a majority or consensus, then only the results of EP6.4 should be considered valid.
  Absolutely — here's a clearer and more polished version of your section on the main differences between the proposed amendments, with improved grammar, flow, and formatting, while staying faithful to your original content:

## Main Differences Between Proposed Amendments

- **Ballot Reordering and Expressivity**:  
  Both amendments enhance the expressiveness of the SPP voting system, allowing voters to choose both teams and their budgets (as opposed to the current model, where budget size is inferred from ranking). However, **EP6.5** goes further by enabling voters to place an _extended_ budget request **below multiple basic budgets**. This allows voters to express preferences such as: “This team should receive its extra funding, but only after these other teams get their basic funding.”

- **Ballot Interpretation**:  
  Both amendments involve reordering ballots based on how voters rank options.

  - **EP6.4** always bundles a candidate’s basic and extended budget requests together, preserving their relative order in the original ballot.
  - **EP6.5**, on the other hand, only reorders ballots when an _extended_ budget is ranked **above** its corresponding basic budget — to avoid accidental inconsistencies in voter intent.

- **Basic vs. Extended Budget Competition**:

  - In **EP6.4**, a candidate’s basic and extended budgets compete only with each other. Whichever is ranked higher wins.
  - In **EP6.5**, a candidate’s _extended_ budget competes with **all** other allocations for the same budget amount, not just the candidate’s own basic option. This allows for a more nuanced prioritization across teams.

- **Complexity of Rules**:
  - **EP6.4** introduces a custom ballot preprocessing step, a distinct counting method, and special downgrade rules for extended budgets.
  - **EP6.5** has a simplified preprocessing, but achieves similar outcomes through emergent behavior from its ruleset, which may lead to rankings on Snapshot that are more closely aligned with what is displayed in custom UIs.

## Amended rules for the Service Provider Program

### 1. Proposals

Teams can propose a **basic budget**, and optionally an **extended budget**, which is listed as the **extra amount** they’d like on top of the basic. The ballot would include all budget options as independent entries to be ranked independently.

Candidates will have a chance to edit their proposal, but as it stands, these are the current asks:

| Company                          | Basic Scope | Extra Ask |
| -------------------------------- | ----------- | --------- |
| **AlphaGrowth**                  | $400,000    | +$400,000 |

| **GovPal**                       | $300,000    | –         |
| **Lighthouse_Labs**              | $400,000    | –         |
| **Namestone**                    | $800,000    | –         |
| **PYOR**                         | $300,000    | –         |
| **Tally**                        | $300,000    | –         |
| **Unicorn.eth**                  | $300,000    | –         |
| **Web3bio**                      | $500,000    | –         |
| **WebHash**                      | $300,000    | –         |
| **x23.ai**                       | $300,000    | –         |

### 2. Preprocessing Ballots

Before counting, each ballot is checked: if a voter ranks a team’s extra budget above its basic, the basic entry is moved directly above the extra. No changes are made otherwise.

### 3. Creating the Rank

Each entry is treated as a separate candidate and ranked using the **Copeland method**. If two entries have the same number of match victories, **average support** is used as a tiebreaker (in a sports comparison, this would be equivalent to \"total points/goals scored\" being used as a tiebreaker between teams with equal number of victories).

### 4. Budget Allocation

Once ranking is complete, entries are evaluated in order, using a **total budget of $4.5 million**:

1. Assign an entry to the **2-year stream** if it is a **current service provider**, ranked in the **top 10**, _and_ assigning it would **not cause the total allocated to 2-year grants to exceed $1.5 million**.
2. If those conditions aren’t met, assign the entry to the **1-year stream** if its budget fits within the **remaining total budget** (regardless of the 2-year cap).
3. Stop the evaluation if the **$4.5M total budget** has been fully allocated, if there are **no more valid candidates**, _or_ if **“None Below”** is reached.

## Abstract

The Meta-Governance Working Group is responsible for providing governance oversight and supporting the management and operation of working groups through DAO tooling and governance initiatives as well as treasury management for the DAO.

This social proposal is submitted to satisfy the requirements set out in Rule 10.1.1 of the Working Group Rules ([EP 1.8](/dao/proposals/1.8)) and further required by [this snapshot proposal in Nov. 2023 modifying steward rules](https://snapshot.org/#/ens.eth/proposal/0x26a5c8dec547837495707e70446d1e7cd874a91f75753c602998f6e70083a266). If this proposal is passed, the funding request will be included in a collective executable proposal put forward by all three Working Groups.

## Specification

This specification is the amount requested from the DAO treasury to the Metagov Multisig to fulfill anticipated budgetary needs through the next formal funding window in April 2025.

|                            | USDC | ETH | $ENS |
| -------------------------- | ---- | --- | ---- |
| ENS Meta-Gov Main Multisig | 254k | 0   | 0    |

This amount will cover all expected expenses outlined below while leaving a 100k prudent reserve to ensure continuity if future funding is delayed.

## Description

**Current Metagov Wallet Balances**

|                            | USDC | ETH  | $ENS |
| -------------------------- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| ENS Meta-Gov Main Multisig | 286k | 83.7 | 51   |

\*Up to date balance information can be found at https://enswallets.xyz

## Expenditures

Meta-Gov sets aside funds to ensure coverage for mission-critical initiatives. While we strive to estimate term expenditures accurately, the final spending depends on pending initiatives.

### Expected Expenses through April 2025

|                                    | USDC | ETH | $ENS |
| ---------------------------------- | ---- | --- | ---- |
| Steward + Secretary Compensation ¹ | 294k | -   | -    |
| Governance                         | -    | -   | -    |
| Contract Audits                    | 155k | -   | -    |

| Total Balance                      | 639k | -   | -    |

### Governance Distributions

The governance distribution strategy for Term 6 will be announced and posted as a temp check in the forum. This strategy will then be codified by a DAO vote.

### Description of Initiatives/Pods

**Steward + Secretary Compensation**: Working Group Steward and Secretary compensation as required by [revised steward working group rules](https://snapshot.org/#/ens.eth/proposal/0x26a5c8dec547837495707e70446d1e7cd874a91f75753c602998f6e70083a266) and [totaling $294,000 USDC to cover the costs for all 9 stewards and supporting roles for a 6 month period](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/ens-dao-steward-compensation/18063).

¹This is the expected compensation amount based on existing compensation. The Meta-governance working group is required by [EP 4.8](https://docs.ens.domains/dao/proposals/4.8) to announce compensation ahead of the next term's steward nominations. **The current Term 5 stewards will also be proposing Term 6 compensation numbers to the DAO to ensure consensus. This proposal will take place before the Term 6 nominations to comply with [EP 4.8].**

**Governance**: Fee reimbursements and initiatives related to reducing friction in the governance process. This can also include $ENS distributed in order to lower barriers to the governance proposal process. The $ENS distributions to stewards and service providers falls into this category.

**Contract Audits**: Meta-governance maintains a balance to be used for contract audits. These audits are performed independently on contracts that are to be included in executable proposals if those contracts impact or affect any ENS protocol or ENS DAO contracts or processes. Examples would be any proposed changes to the ENS DAO governor contract or protocol related contracts such as the registrar.
This line item is larger than normal because Meta-governance is anticipating potential audits for both governor upgrades and contracts from Service Providers that are contributing to the ENS v2 work.

**DAO Tooling**: Developing interfaces and dashboards to improve the governance process and increase transparency across the DAO. An example of DAO tooling spend is our current engagement with Agora as they help build out an enhanced DAO proposal flow to streamline the proposal process.

**Discretionary**: Funds distributed at the discretion of stewards towards new initiatives + governance experiments. In this cycle, we've consolidated the former DAO Sponsorship category into this discretionary category.

## Conclusion

This funding request will allow the ENS Meta-Governance Working Group to continue its essential work in providing governance oversight, supporting the management and operation of working groups, and ensuring effective treasury management for the DAO. The requested funds will enable us to maintain our ongoing initiatives and develop new tools to enhance the governance process. We are grateful for the community's ongoing support and engagement, which is crucial to the success of the ENS DAO. The Meta-Governance Working Group remains committed to serving the ENS community and driving the long-term growth and sustainability of the ecosystem.

## Description of Initiatives

### [Large Grants](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/public-goods-group-budget-h1-2024/18725#large-grants-3)

Grants up to 50k USDC with applications accepted on a rolling basis throughout the year-long term. Large Grants will resume in Q2. With five grantees completing milestones from last term, the budget includes remaining payouts yet to be
disbursed. We plan to add at least two more grantees during Q2 while piloting new grants management software. In the second half of the year, we will run another full-size round supporting up to 10 grantees at a time with a 200k USD total prize
pool.

### [Small Grants](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/public-goods-group-budget-h1-2024/18725#small-grants-4)

Multiple micro-grantsvoted on by the community. Small Grants will resume during the first half of the year shortly after ETHDenver. We have added the amount expected to spend through the end of the year with no increase from last term. This is
approximately 12.5 ETH per quarter. With market fluctuations, stewards may right-size and lower the amounts distributed during round

### [Events and Hackathons](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/public-goods-group-budget-h1-2024/18725#events-and-hackathons-5)

The working group will support Public Goods events and hackathons. Funds have included expenses related to the funding of hackathons, events, and related participation in events (judging, panels, speaking) where necessary.

The current earmarked events are:

- [ETHGuatemala](https://ethereum.gt/)
- [EthLatam](https://ethlatam.org/)
- [ETHGlobal London](https://ethglobal.com/events/london2024)
- [ETHCanal](https://www.ethcanal.xyz/)
- [ETHCC](https://ethcc.io/)
- [ETHGlobal Brussels](https://ethglobal.com/events/brussels)
- [DAO Tokyo](https://dao-tokyo.xyz/)
- [ETHGlobal San Francisco](https://ethglobal.com/events/sanfrancisco2024)
- [ETHGlobal Bangkok](https://ethglobal.com/events/bangkok)
- [Devcon](https://devcon.org/en/)

This list is not guaranteed as several events are still in the planning stages.
The PG stewards will continuously assess opportunities to expand the public goods conversation and collaborations.

### [Discretionary](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/public-goods-group-budget-h1-2024/18725#discretionary-6)

The funds in this initiative are reserved for additional grant opportunities and expenses that arise during the term. Spending on this initiative is at the discretion of the working group stewards.

## Abstract

Since 2017, ENS Labs has been operating eth.link as a public gateway for the Ethereum community, providing access to ENS+IPFS sites. Eth.link has been used by some of the largest projects in the space, including Uniswap.

Eth.link was kindly delegated to ENS Labs for this purpose by its owner, Virgil Griffith. In August 2022, a dispute arose between ENS Labs, Dynadot, GoDaddy, and Manifold Finance about ownership of eth.link after the transfer and auction of the domain without ENS' consent. The highest bidder for eth.link at the auction was Manifold Finance, who expressed their intention to [operate the service themselves](https://twitter.com/foldfinance/status/1566200320375476225). A full recitation of the facts surrounding the dispute can be found within [the complaint that ENS Labs filed](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1951CeiKQZ4jQvcpjKU53BnugVedIf8go/view?usp=sharing) in September 2022.

Before the domain could be transferred, ENS Labs and Virgil successfully obtained a preliminary injunction from a federal district court judge in Phoenix, Arizona. The Court ordered that Dynadot had to immediately return eth.link to ENS Labs. Since then, this litigation has been proceeding slowly through the courts. ENS Labs had to enforce the preliminary injunction as to Dynadot and Manifold Finance exited the lawsuit on jurisdictional grounds. Settlement discussions between the parties indicated that Manifold Finance should be included in any global settlement because of its potential claims to eth.link and against Dynadot.

Recently, Manifold Finance has extended a settlement offer. They are demanding $300,000, along with confidentiality and non-disparagement clauses. In return, they are offering an allparties settlement, which would result in the dismissal of the case and ENS Labs retaining the eth.link domain name.

ENS Labs believes that this is the appropriate juncture to solicit the DAO's input on how to proceed with the litigation. We are thus asking the DAO to instruct ENS Labs on the next steps to take in this case, whether that be agreeing to the settlement, offering a compromise amount, continuing the lawsuit, or dismissing the matter altogether, which would relinquish ENS Labs' possession of eth.link. Thus far, ENS Labs has been funding this litigation from its own finances. Our expenses so far amount to approximately $750,000. Continuing the case is likely to incur substantial additional costs.

Further, given the criticality of eth.link to the ENS ecosystem, we would like to request reimbursement from the DAO for the legal fees incurred in protecting possession of eth.link.

## Specification

This will be an approval vote, with four independent items:

1. Do you approve the proposed settlement?
2. Do you approve of offering a compromise amount?
3. Do you approve of continuing the litigation?
4. Do you approve reimbursing ENS labs for its legal expenses involved in pursuing this case?

You should vote on each outcome you would be happy with. For example, if you would be happy with either continuation or a compromise settlement, but not the full amount, you would vote for options 2, 3 and 4. If you prefer that the case be dismissed, vote only for option 4, or for no options.

If the reimbursement is not approved, or none of the options receive a majority (50%) of approving votes, ENS Labs will:

- Promptly post an interstitial on eth.link, warning users of the potential change in ownership and functionality of the domain, and offering alternatives including eth.limo.
- Dismiss the litigation without delay and without unnecessary further expenditure of funds.

Based on the outcome of the vote, ENS Labs will proceed with the case based on whichever of the courses of action (settlement or continuation) receives the higher proportion of approving votes. Subsequently, ENS Labs will post an executable proposal seeking reimbursement from the DAO for its legal expenses pursuing the case.

## Abstract

Following the RFP process approved in EP2.2.4, the Meta-Governance Working Group stewards have selected a short list of potential fund managers for the DAO to elect to manage the ENS Endowment.

## Specification

EP2.2.4 set out a process for fund managers to submit proposals to the Meta-Governance Working Group for consideration as fund managers over an ENS Endowment. The Endowment's goal is to ensure the long-term viability of ENS by ensuring it can meet its ongoing financial obligations even in the face of reduced ETH price and registration/renewal revenue.

Eight submissions were made as a result of the RFP process, and the stewards have narrowed this down to three finalists. All three finalists are established actors with track records of fund management, and their proposals reflect an understanding of the low-risk, long-term sustainability approach that an endowment should take.

Rather than select a winner themselves, the Meta-Governance Working Group Stewards believe that the selection of a fund manager should be put to the DAO. This EP implements a Snapshot vote using Ranked Choice voting with the following options:

1. Avantgarde
2. Karpatkey
3. Llama
4. None of the above

Submissions for the vote are listed in alphabetical order.

Following the conclusion of the vote, the Meta-Governance Stewards will work with the winning team to develop an initial treasury allocation strategy, resulting in a separate executable proposal to enact the initial setup of the endowment.

### Submission Summary

The table below summarizes the final submissions made by each candidate.

| **Votes**             | [Snapshot](https://snapshot.box/#/s:ens.eth/proposal/0x085a1e40c264ffd44567b6dce889f5943e72cfa8442eaeb81819261a38f0bd0a) |

## Abstract

This proposal suggests introducing and implementing an [Investment Policy Statement (IPS)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NtaKb-9HJf9wJmVOq4sQbhsYQ4yZtTF2) for the ENS Endowment.

The Investment Policy Statement (“IPS”) outlines the principles and guidelines for the effective management of the ENS Endowment Fund (the “Endowment”). And provides additional clarity to the Endowment Manager in their duties of achieving the mandate of the ENS Endowment established in [EP 2.2.4](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/ep2-2-4-social-rfp-ens-endowment/14069).

## Specification

The creation and implementation of the [IPS](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NtaKb-9HJf9wJmVOq4sQbhsYQ4yZtTF2), will serve the following purposes:

1. Define and assign the responsibilities of all parties involved in the Endowment.
2. Establish clear investment goals and objectives for the Endowment assets.
3. Offer guidance and limitations to the Endowment Manager regarding the investment of the Endowment assets.
4. Establish a basis for evaluating the performance of the Endowment Manager.
5. Express the prudent standards that are expected in the management of the Endowment assets.

The proposed ENS Investment Policy Statement to be ratified can be read: [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NtaKb-9HJf9wJmVOq4sQbhsYQ4yZtTF2).

As specified in the IPS, this document will be continually reviewed annually.

### Updates from Feedback

Following discussions, the community provided feedback on the draft IPS posted in the [September temp check post](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/temp-check-proposal-for-introduction-of-ens-investment-policy-statement/19568) and the weekly MetaGov calls.

Based on those discussions, the following changes have been incorporated into the final version of the IPS:

- **More conservative asset allocation:** Increase stablecoin allocation in the Endowment to 40% (up from 20%).
- **Regular transfers:** Introduce regular monthly transfers of income from the Controller to the Endowment to support continuous growth and reduce future funding requests.

## Proposal Success Criteria

For this social proposal to pass, the following quorum and voting requirements must be met:

- **Quorum:** The proposal must receive a minimum of 1% of the total supply of $ENS (1 million votes) in the form of "For" and "Abstain" votes combined. "Against" votes do not count towards quorum.

- **Approval:** Once the quorum is reached, the proposal requires a simple majority (>50%) of "For" votes among the "For" and "Against" votes to pass. "Abstain" votes do not count towards the approval calculation.

If approved, the ENS DAO should adopt the final Investment Policy Statement prepared by karpatkey for the ENS Endowment established under [EP 2.2.4](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/ep2-2-4-social-rfp-ens-endowment/14069). If not approved, karpatkey will reassess and propose an alternative structure based on the feedback received.

## Abstract

This proposal introduces additional actions and strategies to the [ENS Endowment](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/ep3-4-executable-fund-the-endowment-first-tranche/16277?u=alisha.eth), which enhance the Endowment's performance, adaptability, and diversification.

## Motivation

Permissions granted to Karpatkey to manage the Endowment are not static, and require regular updates to effectively respond to evolving market conditions and to capitalize on emerging opportunities.

Any changes to the permissions related to Endowment funds ([endowment.ensdao.eth](https://etherscan.io/address/0x4F2083f5fBede34C2714aFfb3105539775f7FE64)) must be executed by the DAO. To streamline the process for delegates, Karpatkey has bundled all non-urgent changes in this proposal.

### Endowment Update

The latest weekly report shows that the Endowment's ncAUM (non-custodial Assets Under Management) amount is $30.1M, with a capital utilisation of 99.95% and an APR (Annual Percentage Rate) of 2.78%.

Weekly updates on the Endowment can be found in the ENS governance forum [here](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/endowment-weekly-reports/16665?u=alisha.eth). Monthly updates can be found in the ENS governance forum [here](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/ens-financial-reporting-by-steakhouse/16601?u=alisha.eth).

## Specification

Permissions that will be added in this proposal are:

1. Deposit USDC on Compound v3;
2. Deposit DAI on AAVE v3;
3. Deposit USDC on AAVE v3;
4. Deposit DAI on Maker's DSR module;
5. Deposit wstETH - ETH on Balancer;
6. Stake ETH - stETH on Convex;
7. Deposit and stake rETH - WETH on Balancer;
8. Stake rETH - WETH on Aura;
9. Deposit and stake Compound USDC DAI on Curve;
10. Stake Compound USDC DAI on Convex;
11. Deposit and stake Balancer Boosted Aave V3 USD on Balancer;
12. Stake Balancer Boosted Aave V3 USD on Aura;
13. Add swap route CVX - WETH on Curve;
14. Migrate wstETH-WETH position to a new gauge on Aura,
15. Add swap route processor for SushiSwap's concentrated liquidity (v3) pools, and
16. Add swapping options on Cow Swap

The majority of the actions mentioned above were initially presented in the proposal that resulted in the selection of Karpatkey as the Endowment Manager. However, it is important to note that there is one exception, namely action #4 - Deposit DAI on Maker's DSR module. This particular opportunity has emerged as an appealing addition subsequent to the original proposal, presenting a new avenue that was not available at the time of its submission. More details about the new actions are posted below as a comment to this post.

Moving forward, this initial list of actions will be subject to updates based on future market conditions, ensuring the Endowment remains responsive and adaptable.

### Additional information

We propose an updated version of the "Preset permissions - ENS Endowment" [document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ccSDe25I9ojvlbPGT5acqD71LOY9U8xkjBYWJgjJtgI/edit?usp=sharing) that shows all the permissions granted to Karpatkey, including the ones that are being requested now.

The payload to update the preset that needs to be executed by the ENS DAO upon a successful on-chain vote is posted below as a comment to this post along with some additional considerations.

## Abstract

This executable proposal implements the Governance Distribution Pilot Program approved in [EP5.19](https://snapshot.org/#/ens.eth/proposal/0xfa54ff2b55f0495c96ec2d8645241bcff48ca6afe1f4925fb51f29c4667252df). Following the community's selection of the 30k ENS distribution option, this proposal authorizes the transfer of ENS tokens from the treasury to implement the program.

## Specification

This proposal authorizes:

1. The transfer of 30,000 ENS tokens from the DAO treasury to the Meta-governance working group's main wallet (main.mg.wg.ens.eth) for distribution to eligible recipients
2. The Meta-governance working group will then distribute these tokens through 2-year linear vesting contracts according to the allocation table below

This distribution follows the quadratic funding method, which is a progressive ratio where recipients receive ENS tokens proportional to the square root of their USDC/ETH contributions during January-September 2024. The complete distribution table is as follows:

1. Value represents the total received of all transactions
2. Squared Weight is simply the square root of that value, which is used as a weight
3. % of total divided that by the total weight
4. ENS multiplies that percentage to the total budget
5. % of value received is a comparison of the value received in USDC with the value received in ENS, with ENS at $14

## Transaction

```json

  "target": "0xC18360217D8F7Ab5e7c516566761Ea12Ce7F9D72",
  "value": 0,
  "calldata": "0xa9059cbb00000000000000000000000091c32893216de3ea0a55abb9851f581d4503d39b00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000065a4da25d3016c00000"
}
```

## Verification

- Target: ENS token contract (0xC18360217D8F7Ab5e7c516566761Ea12Ce7F9D72)
- Recipient: main.mg.wg.ens.eth (0x91c32893216dE3eA0a55ABb9851f581d4503d39b)
- Amount: 30,000 ENS (30000000000000000000000 in wei)
- Function: transfer(address,uint256)

---

The Meta-governance working group will handle subsequent distributions to individual recipients through Hedgey vesting contracts following the approved allocation table.

The transaction will move the 30k $ENS to the main Meta-governance wallet. After the transaction completes, the Meta-governance working group will craft the Hedgey vesting contracts following the above allocation table.

## Abstract

This proposal aims to roll out an updated version of the Zodiac Roles Modifier module. The new version improves usability and transparency of treasury management operations. Upon approval, the Roles Modifier v2 module will be activated.

Furthermore, this proposal requests authorization from the DAO to revise the permissions policy. A notable change includes enabling swapping actions on CoW Swap while the other permissions primarily focus on eliminating obsolete actions and protocols, and refining parameters within the existing permissions.

# Roles v2 Migration

## Motivation

As [previously stated](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/endowment-initiation/15952#a-list-of-zodiac-roles-modifier-permissions-for-the-manager-role-9), the Zodiac Roles Modifier facilitates karpatkey’s proxy management of the Endowment by ensuring that only pre-approved transactions, defined by the permissions policy voted on by the DAO, can be executed. In collaboration with karpatkey, the Gnosis Guild team has significantly upgraded the Zodiac Roles Modifier module and the Zodiac Roles app. These enhancements have resulted in a more powerful and robust on-chain permissions infrastructure with the following improvements:

- **Introduction of Allowances**: Implementation of spending limits within permissions.
- **Enhanced Call Data Scoping Toolset**: This toolset considerably broadens the range of functions that can have permissions set, increasing flexibility.
- **Advanced Logical Conditions**: Allows for the creation of complex permissions structures to accommodate sophisticated operational needs.
- **Compatibility with** [**DeFi Kit**](https://kit.karpatkey.com/): This feature integrates with karpatkey’s permissions policy building module, facilitating the straightforward crafting of protocol actions.
- **Improved Visualisation and User Interface**: the new [Zodiac Roles app UI 1](https://roles.gnosisguild.org/) not only displays permissions clearly but also provides a user-friendly interface to compare changes in each policy update, enhancing transparency and simplifying audits.

For more detailed information, please refer to the following resources:

- **Documentation**: [The Zodiac Roles Modifier](https://docs.roles.gnosisguild.org/)\
- **Articles**: [Evolving Smart Accounts with Onchain Permissions](https://gnosisguild.mirror.xyz/oQcy_c62huwNkFS0cMIxXwQzrfG0ESQax8EBc_tWwwk), [Permissions as code](https://engineering.gnosisguild.org/posts/permissions-as-code)

## Contract audits

The Zodiac Roles Modifier v2 contract has been rigorously audited by G0 Group, the internal auditing team of Gnosis DAO, and by [Omniscia](https://omniscia.io/). The detailed audit reports are available for review [here 1](https://github.com/gnosisguild/zodiac-modifier-roles/tree/main/packages/evm/docs).

# Changes to Permissions policy

This proposal outlines the following modifications to the permissions policy:

1. **Token Arrays for Swapping**:

- Considering the tokens involved in the existing permissions, we have updated the token arrays to ensure they can be seamlessly swapped across the various whitelisted protocols and aggregators.
- **Token IN Allowlist**: \\[CRV, DAI, USDT, BAL, AURA, CVX, ETHx, COMP, rETH, SWISE, wstETH, LDO, WETH, ankrETH, USDC, stETH].
- **Token OUT Allowlist**: \\[DAI, USDT, USDC, rETH, wstETH, WETH, stETH].
- 4. The above arrays are to be utilised for swapping on CoW Swap, with equivalent lists replicated for Uniswap v3 and Balancer.

2. **Introduction of CoW Swap** ([diff 4](https://roles.gnosisguild.org/eth:0xBd1099dFD3c11b65FB4BB19A350da2f5B61Efb0d/roles/ENS-MANAGER-V1/diff/C0zUV4NtNErufEpbpNc2S55F2oiAGw8aKE2jYwWjLg?annotations=false#right-0x23da9ade38e4477b23770ded512fd37b12381fab)):

- Addition of a **CoW Swap Order signer** to enable gas-minimised and MEV-protected swaps. This includes an extensive set of aggregated exchange routes, improving the efficiency and effectiveness of required swaps.

# Audit Considerations

We highly value the community’s involvement in reviewing and providing feedback on this proposal. We encourage members with the necessary technical expertise to examine the content carefully (including this [payload 1](https://gist.github.com/santinomics/773117b729152f31a121045f4ba26b5b)) and share their insights with us. For effective testing of the permissions policy configuration, we have utilised a [Testing Avatar Safe 1](https://app.safe.global/balances?safe=eth:0xC01318baB7ee1f5ba734172bF7718b5DC6Ec90E1). This safe mirrors the current state of the [permissions policy v4 1](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ker_TkBJV0xmQ9Li9HB-vtdlpx1vEeVEQwpIH6WoK0o) granted by the Endowment to the Manager SAFE operated by karpatkey. The enhancements in the Zodiac Roles app interface now allow for a clear visualisation of all existing permissions, accessible [here 2](https://roles.gnosisguild.org/eth:0xbd1099dfd3c11b65fb4bb19a350da2f5b61efb0d/roles/ENS-MANAGER-V1). The updated interface also simplifies the process of identifying [changes](https://roles.gnosisguild.org/eth:0xBd1099dFD3c11b65FB4BB19A350da2f5B61Efb0d/roles/ENS-MANAGER-V1/diff/C0zUV4NtNErufEpbpNc2S55F2oiAGw8aKE2jYwWjLg?annotations=false) by displaying the current permissions policy on the left side and the newly proposed policy on the right side. To further aid in the adoption and understanding of these tools for audit purposes, we have detailed the proposed changes in [version 5 documentation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KU4a7s-AxAAAPJxd8vexn7kCl8hsr3-c7VIDfEPHbKc/edit), following our standard Policy Update Request (PUR) format.

# Additional Considerations

## Roles Modifier v1 and Enabling of v2

The existing Roles Modifier v1 module will remain active to ensure a smooth transition and prevent any unexpected disruptions in operational execution. Ownership of the deployed [Roles Modifier v2 module 1](https://etherscan.io/address/0x703806E61847984346d2D7DDd853049627e50A40), equipped with the new proposed permissions policy, has been [transferred 1](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x78c69c7ad0c5f430d97ec5c3bac5cb649d831a756b3d4c5b09b45152427ae8f4) to the Endowment’s Avatar Safe. These permissions are displayed [here 4](https://roles.gnosisguild.org/eth:0x703806e61847984346d2d7ddd853049627e50a40/roles/MANAGER) and match those shown on the comparison interface [here 1](https://roles.gnosisguild.org/eth:0xBd1099dFD3c11b65FB4BB19A350da2f5B61Efb0d/roles/ENS-MANAGER-V1/diff/rMNui3Yp9LlBScVLFjY9cWkk4QGYoIVkkYxURs16ys?annotations=false). The payload will only activate this module, marking the first phase of the migration process. A subsequent policy update proposal will seek to disable the v1 module.

## Policy Visualisation in Terms of DeFi Kit Actions

The “show annotations” button, located at the top-right [here 1](https://roles.gnosisguild.org/eth:0xBd1099dFD3c11b65FB4BB19A350da2f5B61Efb0d/roles/ENS-MANAGER-V1/diff/rMNui3Yp9LlBScVLFjY9cWkk4QGYoIVkkYxURs16ys?annotations=false), provides a visualisation of the proposed permissions policy expressed through the DeFi Kit Protocol Actions. This feature offers a more abstract and simplified description of the policy, enhancing understanding and accessibility.

## Abstract

The ENS labs team has been working on a new version of the DNSSEC oracle and the DNS registrar that, combined with wildcard resolution (ENSIP 10) and CCIP-Read, allow for 'gasless DNSSEC' - enabling the use of DNS names inside ENS with no onchain transactions required. This proposal replaces the existing DNSSEC registrar with the new one.

Existing DNS names will continue to function as before, and names can still be imported using the 'legacy' method. The new registrar also allows configuring a name by setting a TXT record on \_ens.name.tld, containing the address of a special resolver contract to use, followed by any resolver-specific data. Resolvers designed for the purpose can be configured to parse this extra data, making configuration entirely offchain a possibility.

Alongside the new registrar and oracle contracts, a simple resolver is provided that reads the Ethereum address to resolve a name to from the extra data.

Post-execution, ENS Labs will run a process to upgrade all current DNS TLDs to use the new registrar. TLDs will only function with the new registrar once this (permissionless) transaction is sent for the TLD.

## Specification

Call `setController` on the Root contract at `root.ens.eth`, passing in the address of the new DNS registrar (`0xb32cb5677a7c971689228ec835800432b339ba2b`).

## Abstract

Following discussion in the Metagov funding request thread and feedback on the Temp Check Proposal, we have put together this amendment proposal which looks to add the requirement of vesting to ENS distributions to stewards for the current term.

Under the current proposal, the MetaGov Working Group will be distributed liquid ENS tokens which will then be distributed individually to stewards. As discussed on the forum and on Meta-Gov calls, these tokens should be vested in order to ensure long-term alignment of stewards with the DAO, whilst ensuring that they are able to use the tokens to particiapte in governance.

This proposal is only in reference to adding vesting to current term steward allocations. With more discussion and input needed for any other changes to steward compensation going forward.

## Specification

All ENS disbursements to stewards will be vested on a linear 24 month schedule from the time of their appointment. In line with the 12 month term that each steward serves plus an additional 12 months of vesting to encourage longterm DAO alignment.

This vesting will be implemented by using Hedgey which allows stewards to access the full voting power of their allocated tokens up front, whilst ensuring that the monetary value of these tokens can only be accessed based on the vesting schedule.

All ENS marked for steward compensation will be transferred via executable proposal to the metagov WG multisig. Term 5 stewards were appointed at the beginning of Q1 2024, and as such are already 4 and a half months into their term.

For the current term's stewards, ENS vesting will be scaled retroactively based on the time since their appointment. ~37.5% of ENS will be distributed to stewards directly from the multisig, whilst the remaining ENS will then be deposited into each steward's vesting contract. These contracts will be set up by Hedgey.

## Vote

- For - Apply vesting to the current term
- Against - Do not apply vesting to the current term in line with the 2023/2024 guidance
- Abstain

This vote adjusts the structure of ENS token distributions to stewards, and if passed, the Meta-gov working group will implement this vesting schedule (and associated tooling) for all ENS token distributions to stewards.

In March 2024, blockful uncovered a critical vulnerability that could have led to a [~$150M](https://dune.com/steakhouse/ens-steakhouse) theft and protocol capture. Their subsequent work led to the implementation of the Security Council,
significantly enhancing ENS DAO's resilience against attacks.

## Contribution Details

The team involved is a [different](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/blockful-service-provider-reports/19553#p-54163-other-contributions-not-related-to-service-provider-scope-14) squad than the one working on the scope of the [ENS service provider](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/blockful-service-provider-reports/19553). It was developed by 2 researchers,
1 smart contract engineer and 4 different auditors the team has worked with previously. Summing up to ~600 hours,
the scope includes:

- Comprehensive vulnerability assessment and risk analysis: **[Here](https://mirror.xyz/research.blockful.eth/-PfMduhpxdypPrutofr6099T4ROpsAmX0fPNbvDgR_k)** is our detailed security report.

- Data analysis of ENS governance metrics and study of past DAO attacker's behaviors.

- Design, development and deployment of the Security Council contract and multisig.

- The Security Council was thought with several key features to balance security and decentralization.

- Smart contract implementation and testing ([GitHub](https://github.com/blockful-io/security-council-ens))
- Governance proposal drafting and support [[1](https://snapshot.org/#/ens.eth/proposal/0xf3a4673fe04a3ecfed4a2f066f6ced1539a5466d61630428333360b843653c54), [2](https://snapshot.org/#/ens.eth/proposal/0xa0b1bfadf6853b5b0d59d3c4d73c434fc6389339887d05de805361372eb17c3a), [3](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/ens/proposal/42329103797433777309488042029679811802172320979541414683300183273376839219133)]

More details can be found on the links above for past proposals and the [report](https://mirror.xyz/research.blockful.eth/-PfMduhpxdypPrutofr6099T4ROpsAmX0fPNbvDgR_k).

## Compensation Rationale

As a team that is totally bootstrapped and never received any investment, this support us to keep it sustainable with the resources invested towards this initiative. The requested amount represents fair compensation for:

- The potential loss prevention of ~$150M, capture of the DAO and protocol. The attack is anything but theoretical and there are actually many groups of investors who specialize in "risk free value raiders". They have exerted the attack on other DAOs before. Currently there are [unknown whales](https://etherscan.io/address/0x245445940b317e509002eb682e03f4429184059d#tokentxns) buying ENS for +450 days and have ~2M ENS, showing how feasible the scenario is, more than the average quorum, in one wallet.

- A critical code bug bounty in [ENS is $250k USDC](https://immunefi.com/bug-bounty/ens/scope/#assets). Our work was much beyond identifying and disclosing.

- Significantly lower cost compared to standard rates charged by other security service providers in the DAO space,
  which typically demand liquid compensation. An example is that Open Zeppelin (one of the most reputable players in security) [charges $4M/year at Compound](https://compound.finance/governance/proposals/76),
  which recently [suffered](https://mirror.xyz/research.blockful.eth/v0GEP49oXP1gzMDlyP91-S4XIa8PIOd0vKq-6R8f54I) this type of attack.

- Months of dedicated work by the team involved (researchers, devs and auditors).

- The long-term value added to ENS through enhanced security.

- Our commitment to ENS's long-term success and continued contribution, as evidenced by the 2-year vesting schedule.

## Compensation Structure

- Total amount: 100k USDC + 15k vested ENS tokens
- Vesting period: 2 years
- Vesting start date: April 8 2024 (date of initial research disclosure)
- Vesting schedule: Linear vesting
- Will be sent to the meta-governance multisig transferred and vested to blockful.

## Benefits to ENS DAO

- Sets a positive precedent that **responsible vulnerability disclosure and correction are rewarded**,
  encouraging future security contributions

- Preserves DAO treasury liquidity by using part of the bounty in ENS tokens instead of USDC or ETH

- Enhances governance security by increasing the number of engaged security-focused token holders

## Conclusion

By approving this compensation, ENS DAO acknowledges the critical importance of security research and proactive governance improvements. The vesting structure ensures ongoing commitment and aligns incentives for continued contribution to ENS's security and stability.

# [EP 5.15] [Social] Adding ProposalBond to ENS Governor to make proposing more accessible

## Abstract

The proposal threshold for propose new executable ENS proposals is high, and rightly so. ENS is one of the most popular DAOs and community in the Web3 community and keeping the quality bar of proposals to the highest standard is very important. However, ENS also has the treasury and the desire to expand the community and make proposing easier and more accessible to enable more builders to come and build in ENS.

[Agora](https://agora.xyz/) proposes adding the functionality of the ProposalBond to the ENS DAO Governor that would allow a proposer to propose with a lower threshold, and then the community could vote [For, Against, Against with penalty, Abstain]. If the weight of `Against with penalty + Against > For`, then the proposer does not get their bond back and the proposal does not pass.

To clarify further: a bond is withheld only if a proposal is rejected (the sum of rejections are bigger than the approvals) AND if the "Against with penalty" is bigger than "Against".

This way we align incentives to create good proposals.

## Specification

A discussion in the DAO Meta-Gov working group titled: [Seeking Feedback: ENS Governor Upgrade to make proposing more accessible](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/seeking-feedback-ens-governor-upgrade-to-make-proposing-more-accessible/19296), Agora proposed the following PR on the ENS Governor: [Proposal Bond Pull Request](https://github.com/voteagora/ens-governance-contracts/pull/1) which outlines the code needed to make this change happen.

Since the time of that PR and during the follow up discussions, the community has asked for the following additions:

- Ensure that the ProposalBond work proposed by Agora works with the new Veto rules and security council. This covers the case of a proposal being vetoed from within the timelock therefore making sure we have the code to handle that case. The default case here being that the bond would not be returned.
- Work with OpenZeppelin to see if we can bring this functionality into OZ Governance Core
- Collaborate with ScopeLift to bring in a few sensible defaults to the voting delay period which is currently set to only one block. This leaves the DAO open to attack and the MetaGov working group is agreed on a 24 hour delay to ensure the DAO time to protect itself if needed.

Agora is committed to building public goods and is already working closely with OpenZeppelin to bring innovations of Agora's Governor into OZ Governance Core.

Given that the proposal threshold of this new functionality will be the most important piece, there is a general consensus in the discussion group that `1,000 ENS` is the right initial value. This parameter can later be set governance and moved up and down as we see fit.

## Voting

We are putting this to a simple, for/again/abstain vote

## Next Steps

Should the vote pass, Agora will be responsible for:

- closing out the implementation
- working with ScopeLift to review the code and add in the Voting Delay logic
- securing and organizing the audits
- making any changes raised by the auditors
- getting the code ready for a governor upgrade

### Auditing

Given the potential impact of the change, we are going to work with the ENS MetaGov stewards to do 2 audits on this code: one chosen by Agora, and the other chosen by the stewards.

Agora recommends using [OpenZeppelin](https://www.openzeppelin.com/security-audits), a reputable and top quality auditor in the governance space.

Agora recommends that the MetaGov stewards pick from: [CodeArena](https://code4rena.com/), [Trail of Bits](https://www.trailofbits.com/services/software-assurance/blockchain/), [Spearbit](https://spearbit.com/) or [Trust Security](https://www.trust-security.xyz/services). Each of these are quality auditing firms with a proven track record of working with governance contracts.

Both of these audits will be funded by ENS, and code changes will be implemented by Agora as part of their service contract with ENS, at no additional charge.

Results and changes will be posted for everyone to see

## Success Criteria

For this social proposal to pass, the following quorum and voting requirements must be met:

**Quorum**: The proposal must receive a minimum of 1% of the total supply of $ENS (1 million votes) in the form of "Yes" and "Abstain" votes combined. "No" votes do not count towards quorum.

**Approval**: Once the quorum is reached, the proposal requires a simple majority (>50%) of "Yes" votes among the "Yes" and "No" votes to pass. "Abstain" votes do not count towards the approval calculation.

## Summary

Send 213,049 ENS tokens to a new airdrop contract for users who did not receive the 2x multiplier despite owning a name that was used as a primary ENS name.

## Abstract

One of the criteria used for the ENS airdrop was whether the account had a primary ENS name set. Those accounts that did got a 2x multiplier on their airdrop amount. The intention was to use this as a measure of involvement in the ENS ecosystem; those accounts that set primary ENS names are typically using their names in supported applications, while those that don't are less likely to be doing so.

The way this was implemented was to award the multiplier to all accounts that had interacted with the reverse registrar. This had the unintended side effect that if a user owned an ENS name on account A, and configured it to resolve to account B, which used it as its primary name, account A would get tokens, and account B would get the multiplier. As B doesn't own any names, the multiplier has no effect and the end result is that some users got fewer tokens than they would have if they had used the same account for everything.

This proposal aims to correct this, by introducing a new criteria for determining who to award the multiplier to, and creating a new airdrop contract for all accounts that qualify for the new criteria but not the old one.

In plain english terms, the new criteria is that the account must have at some point in time owned a name that was used as the primary ENS name for an account.

More formally, for each account `a`, the account is assigned the multiplier if there exists a name `n` and a time before 2021-11-01 00:00:00 UTC, where all of the following are true:

1. `a` is the registrant of `n`.
2. `n` has a resolver, `r`, set on the ENS registry.
3. `r` has an `addr` record, `a'`, set for `n`, and has emitted an `AddrChanged` event to record this fact.
4. The reverse record for `a'` has a resolver, `r'`, set on the ENS registry.
5. `r'` has a `name` record, `n'`, set for the reverse record of `a`. `r'` is either the default reverse resolver, or has emitted a `NameChanged` event for `n'` and `a'`.
6. `n == n'`.

This logic is implemented by [this series of BigQuery queries](https://gist.github.com/Arachnid/667178e854945abaecb6dfd3b6c0c279/106d9bc156988cf96786c71f6448f13fb11599fc), and shows that 1,969 accounts meet these criteria but did not qualify for the multiplier under the original criteria. The sum of the tokens these accounts would be entitled to comes to \~213,049 ENS tokens. A list of affected accounts and balances is [here](https://gist.github.com/Arachnid/e8b1a18fc19818fb00f51fbb8d90e429).

Further, a number of users have accidentally transferred their ENS tokens to the token contract, totalling 6,246 contracts across 49 transfers. These tokens should be returned to their previous owners. This proposal, if executed, will transfer 219,295 ENS tokens to [a new merkle airdrop contract ](https://github.com/ensdomains/governance/pull/9)allowing affected users to claim them.

## Specification

1. Request that True Names Limited write and deploy a contract that allows claiming of tokens via Merkle Proofs using the same methodology as was used for the airdrop.
2. Request that True Names Limited make changes to the claim.ens.domains site to support claiming this additional airdrop for qualifying accounts.
3. Authorise the contract deployed in (1) to spend 219295650978169915391391 base ENS tokens from the ENS DAO account.

## Code

```javascript
const ethers = require('ethers')
const abi = [
  'function approve(address _spender, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success)',
]
const token = new ethers.Contract(
  '0xC18360217D8F7Ab5e7c516566761Ea12Ce7F9D72',

## Abstract

Since ENS started allowing registrations using the annual-fee model, revenue from this has accrued to the ENS root multisig, which is controlled by seven individuals drawn from the Ethereum community. In order to shield them from individual tax liability, True Names Limited, the development company responsible for ENS development, historically identified itself as the beneficial owner of these funds, which obliged True Names to pay tax on any income to the multisig.

In past years True Names has covered this tax bill from its own reserves - primarily out of funds that were collected during the Short Name auction - but in 2021 revenue rose to a level that meant that was no longer sustainable. Accordingly, True Names requested funds from the multisig to cover the anticipated tax, and the multisig agreed.

The calculation used to determine the tax owing used the actual income to October 20th, plus a 1/12th buffer to cover the anticipated income between the launch of the DAO and its potential request for control of the funds from the keyholders. This total came to $2,163,921 USDC.

However, this failed to take into account the enormous uptick in interest that the announcement of the DAO produced, and so falls significantly short of True Names' actual tax obligations for FY 2021. This proposal requests that the DAO sends True Names the remainder of the funds required to cover the multisig's income during the period that True Names was the beneficial owner.

Further, True Names has incurred the following expenses on behalf of the DAO in January 2022:

We additionally request the DAO reimburse True Names for these expenses in the total of $48,637.

### Revenue

Revenue to the multisig came exclusively from ENS name registrations and renewals, and can be calculated from onchain data using [this BigQuery query](https://gist.github.com/Arachnid/dfd374886a3e6b0a0eb17b26703d776a), producing the following results:

### Tax

Singapore's company tax rate is 17%, meaning that the tax owing on $19,980,536 comes to $3,396,691. After deducting the $2,163,921 USDC already sent by the multisig, this leaves a shortfall of $1,232,770.

## Specification

We request that the DAO send $1,281,407 USDC to coldwallet.ens.eth.

# [EP 5.18] [Social] ENS DAO Steward Compensation Structure - Term 6

::authors

## Background

The ENS DAO Working Group Rules place the responsibility for steward compensation on the Metagov working group.

**Working Group Rules:**
[[EP0.4] [Social] Proposal: Creation of Foundational Working Groups and Working Group Rules](https://docs.ens.domains/v/governance/governance-proposals/term-0/ep4-social-proposal-creation-of-foundational-working-groups-and-working-group-rules)
[[EP12][Social] Working Group Rules ](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/ep12-social-working-group-rules/12953)

With the passing of [this social proposal](https://snapshot.org/#/ens.eth/proposal/0x26a5c8dec547837495707e70446d1e7cd874a91f75753c602998f6e70083a266) in Term 4, these two rules were added:

> **10.4.** The Meta-Governance working group are responsible for defining standards for fair compensation ('Compensation Guidelines').
> **10.5.** The Compensation Guidelines shall be defined prior to the Nomination Window for each term and can only take effect for the following term.

## Summary

In accordance with rule 10.5, This post outlines the proposed compensation structure for ENS DAO stewards during Term 6. The structure builds upon previous compensation models but includes several important changes. Notably, this compensation proposal will be put to a DAO vote for approval.

## Proposed Compensation Structure

### USDC Compensation

The total USDC compensation is the same as Term 5. The base compensation structure remains similar to previous terms, with some adjustments:

| Role         | Quantity | Per Steward Per Month | Per Steward Per Term | Total per Term |
| ------------ | -------- | --------------------- | -------------------- | -------------- |
| Steward      | 6        | $4,000                | $24,000              | $288,000       |
| Lead Steward | 3        | $5,500                | $33,000              | $198,000       |
| Secretary    | 1        | $5,500                | $33,000              | $66,000        |
| Scribe       | 1        | $3,000                | $18,000              | $36,000        |
| **Total**    |          |                       |                      | **$588,000**   |

([previous structure linked here for reference](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/ens-dao-steward-compensation/18063))

Key changes:

- The discretionary amount has been removed.
- The $3,000 previously allocated to each WG for discretionary compensation has been split evenly among the stewards of that working group.
- Regular stewards will now receive $4,000 USDC per month (up from $3,000).
- Lead stewards will now receive $5,500 USDC per month (up from $4,500).

### $ENS Token Distribution

We are introducing a new structure for $ENS governance distribution to stewards:

1. Each steward will receive $ENS tokens equal in value to their total USDC compensation for the year.
2. The $ENS tokens will be distributed on July 1st, via 2-year linear vesting contracts.
3. The $ENS token price used to calculate the number of tokens each steward receives will be derived from the average daily price of the token between January 1st and July 1st of the term.
4. The vesting period will start from the beginning of the term (January 1st), meaning 6 months of vesting will have already occurred at the time of distribution.

Example calculation:

- A regular steward receiving $48,000 USDC for the year would also receive $48,000 worth of $ENS tokens.
- If the average $ENS price is $12 when calculated on July 1st, the steward would receive 4,000 $ENS tokens in a 2-year linear vesting contract.
- At the time of distribution (July 1st), 25% of the tokens (1,000 $ENS) would have already vested.

This structure ensures that stewards' token compensation aligns with their USDC compensation and incentivizes long-term commitment to the DAO.

### Success Criteria

For this social proposal to pass, the following quorum and voting requirements must be met:

1. **Quorum**: The proposal must receive a minimum of 1% of the total supply of $ENS (1 million votes) in the form of "Yes" and "Abstain" votes combined. "No" votes do not count towards quorum.

2. **Approval**: Once the quorum is reached, the proposal requires a simple majority (>50%) of "Yes" votes among the "Yes" and "No" votes to pass. "Abstain" votes do not count towards the approval calculation.

If approved, this structure will be implemented for Term 6. If not approved, the Metagovernance Working Group will reassess and propose an alternative structure based on feedback received.

_This is an updated budget for this funding window to account for better treasury management at this time - a new funding request may be put forward in the October window which was not initially planned when scoping out this budget_

# Abstract

The Public Goods Working Group exists to fund initiatives that advance public goods funding within the wider ecosystem. We support builders, stewards, and community members working on public goods that are aligned with the values and goals of ENS.

This social proposal is submitted to satisfy the requirements set out in Rule 10.1.1 of the Working Group Rules (EP 1.8). If this proposal is passed, the funding request will be included in a collective executable proposal put forward by all Working Groups requesting funding.

# Specification

This specification is the amount requested from the DAO treasury to the Public Goods Multisig to fulfill anticipated budgetary needs through the next formal funding window in October 2025.

|                      | USDC | ETH | $ENS |
| -------------------- | ---- | --- | ---- |
| ENS PG Main Multisig | 356k | 0   | 0    |

This amount will cover all expected expenses outlined below while leaving a small reserve to ensure continuity if future funding is delayed.

# Description

Current Public Goods Wallet Balances as of April 2, 2025

|                      | USDC | ETH  | $ENS |
| -------------------- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| ENS PG Main Multisig | 139k | 24.6 | 200  |

Updated balance information can be found at enswallets.xyz

# Expenditures

The Public Goods Working Group allocates funds to support the public goods ecosystem through strategic grants, builder grants, and discretionary initiatives. While we aim to estimate expenditures accurately, actual spending may shift based on new opportunities or unforeseen needs.

Expected Expenses through October 2025

|                            | USDC     | ETH   | $ENS  |
| -------------------------- | -------- | ----- | ----- |
| Strategic Grants           | 300k     | -     | -     |
| Builder Grants             | 150k     | -     | -     |
| Discretionary (10% buffer) | 45k      | -     | -     |
| **Total Balance**          | **495k** | **-** | **-** |

# Description of Initiatives

**1. Strategic Grants:** High-impact funding for initiatives aligned with the long-term vision of ENS and the broader public goods ecosystem. We are working on developing strategic initiatives focused on foundational infrastructure alongside our existing grants.

The pilot for Strategic Grants is our funding of the DRC. Since they are also receiving external matching funds for any contribution, our funding of 150,000 USDC equates to $300,000 in total funding dedicated to advancing decentralization advocacy and policy engagement.

Strategic Grants will be characterized by:

**Larger Funding Amounts:** Providing substantial support to initiatives that require more significant resources to succeed
**Internal Expertise Utilization:** Leveraging the expertise of our elected stewards rather than outsourcing key decision-making
**Focused Impact Areas:** Targeting underfunded yet critical areas such as developer tools, core dependencies, and infrastructure
**Measured Outcomes:** Establishing clear criteria for success and impact measurement from the outset

**2. Builder Grants:** Support for builders at all stages of their journey in building public goods. The platform will feature USDC payments as of next month so better accounting and higher amounts of funding can easily be distributed through the already tested and successful mechanism.

**3. Discretionary Buffer:** A 10% margin to provide flexibility for time-sensitive or emergent opportunities that align with the working group’s mandate. This may include hackathon sponsorship or event support.

**Conclusion**

This funding request will allow the Public Goods Working Group to continue its essential work in stewarding public goods funding. These resources will help us support a diverse set of builders, projects, and community-driven efforts, ensuring long-term sustainability and alignment with ENS values.

We are grateful for the ongoing support and engagement with our work.

# Abstract

This proposal aims to introduce new permissions for deploying Endowment funds, focusing on improved diversification and alignment with the evolving market landscape and liquidity. We are also introducing an independent audit report together with the Permissions Update; this will be the standard practice for Permissions Updates going forward.

# Motivation

Effective treasury management strategies must be adapted to market conditions and protocol updates; for existing Permissions, there might be migrations and introductions of new pools; for new Permissions, protocols and pools that were previously considered immature and unsuitable for the Endowment’s risk appetite may become viable options as they become more time- and battle-tested. This proposal seeks to request new permissions from the ENS DAO for karpatkey, enabling the introduction of new yield-generation strategies for the Endowment.

The new permissions have also been audited by [ThirdGuard](https://thirdguard.com/), an independent 3rd-party, to ensure the suggested changes have been thoroughly reviewed by a technically-competent, independent party.

# Specification

## New permissions implemented in this payload

1. Deposit osETH on Aave v3;
2. Stake (and unstake) ETH on Stakewise v3;

   1. Through the [Genesis Vault](https://app.stakewise.io/vault/mainnet/0xac0f906e433d58fa868f936e8a43230473652885).

3. Mint (and burn) osETH on Stakewise v3;

   1. Through the Genesis Vault

4. WETH/osETH pool on Balancer;
5. WETH/osETH pool on Aura Finance;
6. Swaps:

   1. WETH &lt;&gt; osETH on Balancer
   2. USDC &lt;&gt; osETH on Uniswap v3
   3. USDC &lt;&gt; WETH &lt;&gt; osETH on CoW Swap
   4. RPL &lt;&gt; WETH on Uniswap v3
   5. RPL &lt;&gt; WETH on CoW Swap

7. Unsign order on Cow Protocol so that a pending order that has been submitted but not executed can be cancelled.

## Additional implementation details

1. The enableModule(address module) function is called to enable the modules, pointing it to the [Avatar address](https://app.safe.global/home?safe=eth:0x4F2083f5fBede34C2714aFfb3105539775f7FE64) (the Endowment).
2. The payload to be executed upon the successful approval of this proposal can be found [here](https://gist.github.com/JeronimoHoulin/55f50e86d1dc874e4e685d5e9b496a67). The proposed permissions policy can be visualised in the aforementioned [link](https://roles.gnosisguild.org/eth:0x703806E61847984346d2D7DDd853049627e50A40/roles/MANAGER/diff/C5Twf3khKv2Ny8PvzoARgHFKFFK8vIiNR7nDkrIM?annotations=false) for ease of review.
3. We have tested the payload to make sure all interactions mentioned on this proposal work as expected through our [Test Safe](https://app.safe.global/transactions/history?safe=eth:0xC01318baB7ee1f5ba734172bF7718b5DC6Ec90E1).
4. With the introduction of the [new Roles App Permissions Visualisation tool](https://roles.gnosisguild.org/eth:0x703806E61847984346d2D7DDd853049627e50A40/roles/MANAGER?annotations=false), manually updating the “Preset Permissions - ENS Endowment” [document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KU4a7s-AxAAAPJxd8vexn7kCl8hsr3-c7VIDfEPHbKc/edit?usp=sharing) is no longer necessary. The new tool provides an up-to-date and accurate method for exploring the current permissions granted to karpatkey by the ENS DAO.

# Auditing process

## Introduction of an independent audit report

We have received feedback in the previous proposal that independent, 3rd party code review would be helpful for the ENS community and delegates to make a more informed decision and to reduce delegate fatigue.

In our commitment to transparency and effort towards DAO efficiency, karpatkey decided to engage with independent, third-party firms / individuals for every contract upgrade starting with this proposal. [ThirdGuard](https://thirdguard.com/) has been engaged for this proposal's code review; ThirdGuard is a provider of on-chain risk monitoring solutions, and has been working with the Zodiac Roles Modifier since its inception (and its precursor, Scope Guard). Given their past experiences across Zodiac Roles Modifier, Solidity, and DeFi risk management, ThirdGuard was deemed to be a suitable candidate to fulfil the role of policy reviewer. Their approach to auditing the permissions can be found [here](https://www.loom.com/share/0b3cbcd6907a4455ab45ead4887c7f9a?sid=9bd0a2c7-d932-45c0-acad-8516201c56ea).

**The ThirdGuard audit for the permissions in this payload can be found [here](https://github.com/ThirdGuard/roles-policy-audits/blob/main/ENS/ens-policy-audit-v2-21st-Aug-2024.pdf).**

Audit report summary is as follows:

- No material findings were found.
- Policy changes requested were considered bona fide actions needed by the Manager to carry out their DeFi operations.
- 1 Informational Finding and 1 Warning were logged, and acknowledged by karpatkey. These findings do not post an immediate risk but are relevant to security best practices.

_Note: This was previously numbered EP7.2._

## Summary

The Ecosystem WG is requesting funding to start the Q1/Q2 2022 term. The initial request is made up of three components:

1. Elected steward compensation: $27,500 in USDC/DAI
2. Bounties for the Bug Bounty program: $50,000 in USDC/DAI
3. Ecosystem WG operational budget: $50,000 in USDC/DAI, 6 ETH, and 6,500 $ENS

#### Bug Bounty

The ENS Bounty Program provides bounties for bugs. This program has been running since 2017 and historically has been funded by True Names Limited (TNL). With the creation of the DAO, the DAO is now able to manage and fund the bug bounty. Details of the program can be found [here](https://docs.ens.domains/bug-bounty-program). The $50,000 will be awarded to developers outside of TNL who find vulnerabilities in the ENS protocol. As well as funding for white hat coding in response to system vulnerabilities which arise.

#### Operational Budget

The operational budget supports ecosystem subgroups with the following allocations:

| Subgroup Name        | Description                                                                                                                       | USDC/DAI | ETH        | $ENS  |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- | ---------- | ----- |
| Hackathons           | Bounties, judging, and facilitating and managing ENS's hackathon participation.                                                   | $10,000  |            |       |
| Integrations         | Bounties for ecosystem integration support                                                                                        | $10,000  | 500        |       |
| 3rd Party Projects   | Support projects that improve the ENS ecosystem, through proactive and retroactive grants.                                        | $10,000  | 6          | 1,000 |
| Bug Bounty           | Administer the bug bounty program                                                                                                 | $5,000   |            |       |
| WG Unallocated Funds | Funds to be allocated to the above subgroups or facilitate the funding of new subgroups as the council of stewards deem necessary | $15,000  | 5,000      |       |
| Total                | $50,000 USDC/DAI                                                                                                                  | 6 ETH    | 6,500 $ENS |       |

#### Elected Steward Compensation

Provide compensation for the stewarding and the coordination efforts of active elected stewards.

| Description               | Compensation | Months #         | Stewards # | Total   |
| ------------------------- | ------------ | ---------------- | ---------- | ------- |
| Base Compensation         | $1,000/month | 5.5              | 3          | $16,500 |
| Supplement compensation\* | $2,000/month | 5.5              | N/A        | $11,000 |
| Total                     |              | $27,500 USDC/DAI |            |         |

\*Supplement compensation is allocated to the steward who supports coordination or who has greater involvement in DAO activities above what is expected of a steward. The steward council determines how the supplemental compensation is split between the stewards based on contributions of each steward.

It should be noted that the ecosystem working group has three elected stewards (@slobo.eth, @Ginge.eth, @bobjiang) and two appointed stewards (@nick.eth, @jefflau.eth). The appointed stewards are not compensated via this request.

# [EP 6.3] [Social] Renew Service Provider Budget

::authors

The Service Provider's streams were initiated almost exactly a year ago, and while it's approved for 18 months, it is supposed to be a program reevaluated yearly. Here is the proposed format for this year. This vote intends to be a DAO check on whether to renew the program and if so, under what budget.

## Vote

The vote will be a Ranked Choice Vote on either to approve or reject and budget. Options will be:

- Renew and increase budget to $4.5 Million per year
- Renew and maintain budget at $3.6 Million per year
- Renew but reduce budget to $2.7 Million per year
- Do not renew the program.

The budget is set per year. However the actual required budget will need to cover 19 months, because as detailed below, 1/3 of the streams will be budgeted for 2 years and we will add another 3 months of runway to make sure the program is not interrupted by eventual delays in the 2026 vote.

## What is the Service Provider Program

The ENS constitution states that \"Any income generated to the ENS treasury is to be used first of all to ensure the long-term viability of ENS, and to fund continuing development and improvement of the ENS system.\". The goal of this program is to create a more diverse and decentralized base of developers and companies involved in the improvement of the ENS system, by creating a guaranteed income stream to support their continued work. Streams last at least one year.

## Who can apply?

Any company offering services they believe will add value to the ENS ecosystem is eligible to apply. While this process has traditionally focused on developers, delegates now have discretion to determine what services qualify as beneficial.

### Eligibility Requirements:

- The applicant must be an existing company, over one year old, with an established team and reputation.
- The company or its team members must have serious prior experience with ENS, blockchain, or internet domain related projects.
- The company must secure endorsement of at least 50k delegated ENS tokens, either through public backing by a delegate or by demonstrating support via Snapshot.
- Neither the company nor its team members may reside in OFAC-sanctioned countries.

## Submission Process

**Candidates will be required to submit a proposal demonstrating their eligibility and outlining their plans. The proposal must include the following:**

1. **Past Achievements:**  
   A list of their accomplishments in ENS, the blockchain space, or domain systems.

2. **Scope of Work and Budgets:**

   - A **basic scope**, which outlines the minimum yearly budget they would accept to perform their work, along with the specific goals and deliverables they aim to accomplish within that budget.
   - Optionally, they may also provide an **extended scope**, which includes an increased budget and details the additional projects or goals they would pursue if granted this higher budget.

3. **Proposal Format:**  
   The submission must be provided both as a written document and as a short video (no longer than 5 minutes) where the team discusses the above points.

4. **Quarterly KPIs:**  
   The proposal must include a set of quarterly Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to define what \"success\" looks like for their basic and extended scope. These may include specific targets, such as product releases, user acquisition numbers, or other measurable metrics that can be used to evaluate their progress against their own promises. Althought we encourage developers to explore new areas of research outside these given metrics, considerable thought should be given to these metrics, and every quarter you will be required to post an update on them. Failing targets in two consecutive targets will trigger a Service Assessement (see below) by Metagov stewards.

5. **Budget Guidelines:**
   - All budgets must be submitted as integer multiples of $100k per year.
   - The minimum budget request is $300k per year, and the maximum is $1.3M per year.

## What will be selection proccess look like?

1. **Eligibility & Voting**

   - The MetaGov Working Group reviews candidates for eligibility.
   - Eligible candidates are included in a ranked-choice DAO vote with the option **\"None Below\"**.
   - A quorum of **1M ENS** votes is required; otherwise, the process halts and a new vote is conducted.

2. **Budget Streams**

   - **Two-Year Stream**: 1/3 of the yearly budget for a two-year duration.
   - **One-Year Stream**: Remaining 2/3 of the yearly budget for one year.

3. **Evaluation Process**  
   Projects are assessed in ranked order:

   - If **\"None Below\"** is reached, evaluation stops.
   - If the candidate has been part of the Service provider program for at least a year AND if the **extended budget** fits within the remaining two-year stream budget, assign to the **two-year stream** . Subtract the extended budget from the two-year stream budget.
   - Assign to the **one-year stream** if:
     1. The **extended budget** fits the one-year budget. Subtract its extended budget from the one-year stream.
     2. OR if the **basic budget** fits the one-year budget, subtract the its basic budget from the one-year stream.
   - If none of these conditions are met, the project is eliminated.

4. **Completion**
   - Evaluation ends when all projects are assessed, the remaining budget on all streams reaches zero or **\"None Below\"** is selected.

## Relevant Dates

The Submission process will start as soon as this vote ends, the deadline for submission of proposals will be \*March 31st\*\* and the vote for the selection will start soon after that. Those with the two year stream will be guaranteed a stream until at least february 2027, while the others will be at least february 2026, when they will need to submit again.

## Resposibilities for selected service providers

### Brand name and association with ENS DAO

Selected providers will be rewarded with the streams, but will also carry the responsibility to represent ENS to the world. They will be granted usage of the ENS brand name (within guidelines).

The stream will be managed by the Metagovernance Stewards, but they are to enact representing the DAO's intent. They will have access to pause or move streams due to security concerns or upon the request of the service provider. They can only terminate a stream if there is a sucessful DAO vote requesting them to do so (which the DAO is free to do at any point for any reason).

### Open Source

All work done directly funded by this program must be Open Source and Freely Licensed (MIT). Service Providers are free to also have proprietary codebases but the works establised in their proposals and quarterly reports must also be available on github or other public repositories.

### Quarterly reports

Service Providers must provide a detailed written report on their accomplishments every quarter. They are also required to present at working group meetings when requested by stewards and to give at least one presentation at a conference each year (remote attendance is acceptable if necessary). These reports must include any metrics or KPIs promised for the reporting quarter, as well as any new metrics or KPIs proposed for future quarters. Additionally, the report must state the total amount received during the quarter. While Service Providers are encouraged to include financial spending details, this is at their discretion and not a mandatory requirement.

### Increased funding

Selected service providers may request specific, non-recurring grants at any time, following the usual governance process on the forum. However, to request an increase in their ongoing stream budget, they must meet the following conditions:

- They must have been a service provider for at least one year.
- At least six months must have passed since their most recent stream-related request, whether it was part of a service provider submission or another stream adjustment process, regardless of either it was sucessful or not.

Service Providers can terminate their own stream at any time without notice, thus liberating them from any further obligations towards the DAO. (Note: Terminating their stream does not exempt them from potential liability for any misconduct or unresolved issues.)

## Responsabilities for Metagov Working Group

The ENS DAO can terminate streams for any reason following the proper governance procedure and after a DAO vote. Additionally, Metagov or Ecosystem Stewards can and should trigger a Service Assessement if any of these conditions are met:

- A service provider fails to publish their quaterly report twice
- A service provider falls short of the KPIs on their proposal twice _in a row_.
- A service provider is unresponsive to attempts to contact them
- A service provider is believed to be actively participating in a behavior or project that is considered harmful to the ENS system or brand.

The Metagov Working will then appoint a person that will conduct an investigation on the claims and publish recommendations on how to solve the issue moving forward. Solutions might include (but are not limited to) a reconsideration of new KPIs, a demand of internal reorganization for the service provider, a renegotiation of terms or even the termination from the program. Once the report is published, a DAO wide vote will executed to decide on the proper outcome for the provider.

# [EP 5.19] [Social] Governance Distribution Pilot Program

| **Votes**             | [Snapshot](https://snapshot.box/#/s:ens.eth/proposal/0xfa54ff2b55f0495c96ec2d8645241bcff48ca6afe1f4925fb51f29c4667252df) |

## Objective:

This proposal establishes a pilot program to distribute ENS governance to eligible DAO contributors who have been selected by the DAO to receive a grant, bounty, or other payment for services. The program would also serve as a pilot, and if successful, could become a long-term initiative, aiming to cover all DAO USDC and ETH recipients, while setting a policy for future governance distribution.

The intent is to engage contributors in governance. We believe governance distribution increases access to DAO governance, enhances the utility of the token, decreases the amount of tokens purely used in markets, increases delegation and the safety of the DAO, and helps align developers and other contributors who bring value to the DAO.

## Context:

- **Previous Distributions**:

  - [90k ENS tokens to stewards](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/5-8-social-ens-steward-vesting-proposal/19059)
  - [80k ENS tokens to service providers and security council members](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/distribution-of-80k-ens-tokens-to-service-providers-and-security-council-members/19541)

- **Proposed Distribution**:
  - This vote is to determine if the program is approved and to select its budget within a range between 0 and 90k ENS.

## Matching Program:

The distributions are calculated using a progressive ratio, meaning that the more you receive in dollar value from the DAO, the more you will receive in absolute values in ENS, but less relatively to the amount, following a quadratic formula. The process is as follows:

1. **Calculate all eligible transfers**: First, we list all transfers from the various DAO wallets into external wallets from January to September 2024. Data is collected from the [ENS Ledger app](https://ens-ledger.app).
2. **Exclude ineligible transactions**: Transactions to Stewards, ENS Labs, Service Providers, and other transactions that are considered refunds or payments for goods are not counted.
3. **Calculate the square root of the total value received**: The total weights are calculated to determine the percentage of the budget each recipient will receive. That calculation and further details can be seen in [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hnrBSPy5efi2W0b4hd4y2BnAmRIfI0M5y4NgYGjEPms/edit?usp=sharing).
4. **Decide the program's total budget**: The total budget will be determined by this vote.

## Voting Method:

The vote will use a ranked choice voting system with options of 0, 30k, 60k, and 90k ENS.

An Instant Run-Off will be calculated, and if the budget option of 0 wins, or if the total votes are less than 1 million, then the proposal will be considered rejected.

## Distribution Table:

The table below is from the [ENS ledger](https://ens-ledger.app), excluding Stewards, Service Providers, ENS Labs, refunds, and internal wallets. ETHGlobal Hackers are bounties given by ETHGlobal to hackathon winners. The final number of hackers is still being calculated, but here it is presented as a maximum of 100. If the final number is less than this, then more ENS will be distributed to other recipients, and if it is greater, it will be capped at 100. This proposal covers transactions from January 2024 to September 2024, and the final table may be subject to change upon legal or technical review.

## Abstract

The primary mission of ENS DAO is to govern the protocol and allocate resources from the treasury in line with the DAO's constitution and broader objectives. However, due to changing economic dynamics, the DAO is increasingly vulnerable to attacks aimed at draining its treasury.

To safeguard the DAO's integrity and longevity, a Security Council with the authority to cancel malicious proposals is needed. To avoid perpetuating centralized power, the Security Council's authority will have a built-in expiration date. After two years, anyone will be able to call a function that revokes the council's power to veto proposals, ensuring a time-limited mechanism to counter malicious attacks while promoting more delegation and governance distribution.

## Motivation

As ENS continues to grow, its treasury in ETH is always growing. Simultaneously, the percentage of tokens actively delegated is on the decline.

![Dune.png](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/bafkreifqrdrm5t3qzlbbsssdlebild2azbfovyjixwa5cedlg5f3ijsxuu)

This imbalance creates a risk where an attacker could acquire enough $ENS to gain control of the DAO at a cost lower than the treasury's total value. This has been a growing concern since March 2023.

![image](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/bafkreicuwrazcaaxvn6ywavjzc2ozutbmnbt5q2pd2lfakb6d7iszfq4q4)

Past attacks on DAOs have exploited similar vulnerabilities, with some [being thwarted](https://twitter.com/AragonProject/status/1656028382939815937) by components with veto power. Currently, the ENS governance process involves a proposal passing through the governor, relying on delegated voting power for approval. If approved, the governor queues the proposal in a timelock contract, delaying execution by two days. While the governor can cancel proposals, it follows the same pathway as a malicious proposal, introducing potential risks.

The short-term solution was delegating 3.8M $ENS to a contract that can only vote "Against"; more details about this can be found in [Nick's forum post](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/introducing-veto-ensdao-eth/19088). The attack is still profitable and, depending on market conditions can be up to a 3x ROI, like in Dec 2023. We need a mid-term solution to cancel the attack, which is this proposal. An article about this research done by the Blockful team will be published [here](https://blockful.io/blog/ens-security-council-snapshot) after the proposal is executed and there is no attack risk.

## Specification

To enhance security, a veto contract will be deployed. Controlled by a Security Council multisig and will have the PROPOSER_ROLE in the timelock, granting it the ability to cancel proposals without the power to initiate or modify other DAO actions. The scope of this proposal is to assign the PROPOSER_ROLE to the veto contract,

To ensure decentralization, the contract will also feature a time-based expiration mechanism that allows anyone to revoke the PROPOSER_ROLE after two years. This window provides time to strengthen delegation and address current vulnerabilities, facilitating the DAO's transition to a more secure governance model.

## Security considerations

Assigning the PROPOSER_ROLE to a multisig within the timelock contract is overly broad for our requirements as it allows the address to add proposals directly to the queue. If the multisig signers are compromised, they could potentially propose and execute malicious changes. Therefore our approach would be to deploy a new contract similar to the current veto.ensdao.eth contract, which can only do one action: to CANCEL a transaction in the timelock. That would be a trivially simple contract and it would be hard locked to only accept calls from a newly created SAFE multisig.

The risk is mitigated but one scenario remains: if the whole multisig is compromised then a malicious entity could kick other signers and effectively stop the DAO from executing proposals by canceling all transactions, including any that would remove this contract from the proposal role. Anyways, after 2 years, anyone can remove the proposal role.

With that in light. the following considerations are essential for ensuring the Security Council's multisig operates securely:

- Availability of Signers: It is critical to avoid scenarios where signers are unavailable during emergencies. Events like the Shanghai attack, where real-life occurrences prevent signers from accessing their wallets, must be avoided. Council members should ensure wallets and necessary equipment are accessible at all times.
- Secure Wallet Practices: Security Council addresses should be exclusive to ENS-related operations. Private keys must be stored using best practices to minimize exposure to risks.

Finding the right balance for the multisig threshold is crucial. A higher threshold can complicate coordination but reduces the risk of malicious activity. A lower threshold, while more agile, could make the DAO more susceptible to attacks or unintended consequences if a few signers are compromised. The suggested composition is a 4/8 multisig.

## Council Operations

It is in the best interest of everyone to make clear the expectations and responsibilities ENS DAO put on those members, backed by the reputation, other roles and gains those might have in the organization.

The security council is expected to act only in emergency, in the given following situations or similar cases:

- If a proposal goes against the ENS constitution
- If a proposal is approved with malicious intent against the DAO longevity/sustainability
- If such proposal is approved by any group of voters, but directly financially incentivised to vote against the DAOs interests to preserve their own financial stake.
- If any approved proposal goes directly against the DAO for the sole benefit of an attacker.

Those definitions are not exhaustive, and the trust deposited in the elected members for the council also encompasses the trust in their capacity to:

- understand ENS DAO thoroughly
- listening to the community feedback on extreme situations
- take quick action on behalf of the DAO
- comprehend the proposals being approved and their repercussions

The Security Council members will be the same signers for the veto.ensdao.eth, their identities are known, have signed a pledged to uphold the ENS constitution and live in countries with a solid legal system.

## Abstract

The Public Goods Working Group requests funding of 250,000 USDC and 50 ETH from the ENS DAO for Q1/Q2 2023.

This funding will be used to support projects and builders as provisioned by Article III of the ENS DAO Constitution, which provides for the funding of public goods in web3.

This social proposal is submitted to satisfy the requirements set out in Rule 10.1.1 of the Working Group Rules ([EP 1.8](https://docs.ens.domains/v/governance/governance-proposals/term-1/ep12-working-group-rules)). If this proposal is passed the funding request will be included in a collective executable proposal put forward by all three Working Groups.

## Abstract

The .ceo TLD, formerly owned by Kred Pty, has since been acquired by XYZ. Prior to the formation of the DAO, the previous owner asked for .ceo to be delegated to a custom address so they can manage a bespoke DNS integration. The new owner has requested that this change be undone, and that ownership of .ceo be reverted to the DNSSEC registrar so owners of .ceo TLDs can use the standard integration to claim their names on ENS.

To prove ownership of .ceo and their intention that we action this request, they have set a TXT record on `_ens.nic.ceo` to the address of the DNSSEC registrar, `0xB32cB5677a7C971689228EC835800432B339bA2B`. This can be verified with the following command:

```
dig TXT _ens.nic.ceo
```

## Specification

Call `setSubnodeOwner` on the ENS `Root` contract at `0xaB528d626EC275E3faD363fF1393A41F581c5897`, passing in the keccak256 hash of `ceo` and the address of the DNSSEC registrar, `0xB32cB5677a7C971689228EC835800432B339bA2B`.

# [EP 5.6] [Executable] Enable Self-Funding for the Endowment

Authorizes metagov to withdraw 30 ETH from the endowment each month for fees, and reimburses metagov for 43.54 ETH in fees already incurred.

## Abstract

This proposal outlines a strategic shift allowing the Endowment to autonomously finance its operations. Specifically, it grants the Metagov stewards the authority to withdraw up to 30 ETH monthly from the Endowment, designated for payments to karpatkey and [@steakhouse](https://discuss.ens.domains/u/steakhouse) for their services in managing the Endowment. This initiative provides the stewards with a direct allowance for these expenses, eliminating the need for these costs to be continually factored into their requests for DAO budget allocations.

Additionally, this proposal seeks to reimburse the [Metagov Safe](https://etherscan.io/address/0x91c32893216dE3eA0a55ABb9851f581d4503d39b) for the payments made to karpatkey and Steakhouse Financial during 2024, covering the service fees for [January](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x4ef4b34d397e6ce1fbe1fbe3e94340dcf02d590fc9d93c7107a76282beb201c6) and [February](https://etherscan.io/tx/0xdd631a42ccc3762e285276043926c52b86dedbc70fa34dddd611585a38534a89), which total 43.54 ETH.

## Motivation

Since the initiation of the Endowment through the execution of the [first tranche](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/ep3-4-executable-fund-the-endowment-first-tranche/16277#specification-3), payments to karpatkey and Steakhouse Financial for their services have been categorized as operational expenditures. These costs were funded through the Metagov Safe, necessitating routine funding requests from the Meta-Governance Working Group to the DAO.

To simplify and enhance the financial autonomy of the Endowment, we propose granting a monthly allowance of up to 30 ETH to the Metagov Safe by leveraging the Spending Limits feature available on Safe.

This measure allows Metagov stewards to settle Endowment fees directly from funds within the Endowment itself, thus eliminating the regular necessity to refill the Metagov Safe. Should the allowance cap be reached, further withdrawals will be paused until the commencement of the next 30-day cycle. This adjustment eradicates the need for frequent funding operations, paving the way for the Endowment's sustained self-sufficiency.

The monthly cap of 30 ETH has been carefully chosen to align with the Endowment's scale and historical fee structure, ensuring it suffices to cover monthly expenses. Should there be a need to revise this limit to better suit future requirements, adjustments can be facilitated through the submission of a new proposal.

Finally, to ensure the strategic shift is applied retroactively from the outset of 2024, this proposal requests that the Endowment reimburse the Metagov Safe for expenses incurred through payments to karpatkey and Steakhouse Financial. This reimbursement, aimed at covering the service fees for January and February 2024, amounts to a total of 43.54 ETH.

## Specification

The following payload will be executed by the DAO Wallet to create the mentioned allowance and refund:

## Abstract

The ENS Public Goods Working Group requests funding to support operations until the next funding window in April 2025.

The Public Goods working group funds projects and builders improving the Web3 ecosystem. This funding stream is authorized in Article III of the ENS DAO Constitution. The funding supports initiatives related to open-source software, tooling, research and any practical implementations that broadly benefit a wide range of users of Ethereum and Web3.

The funds requested extends current need through to next term to ensure that next season’s stewards have some available funding before the next funding window available.

The total request in this proposal is 226k USDC to be transferred from the DAO wallet to the Public Goods Working Group.

## Specification

This specification is the amount requested from the DAO treasury to the Public Goods Multisig to fulfill anticipated budgetary needs through the next formal funding window in April 2025.

![](https://ipfs.punkscape.xyz/ipfs/bafkreigs2h6fb5zpnsep76k3qejqlcwz757bgsl3vjsn7muvvgigta5q7a)
![](https://ipfs.punkscape.xyz/ipfs/bafkreictfvsa3fq2xv3rnnlnqdulphsq5d7s5eybiyvbjnqz5umqstsewu)

Of these funds, 256k is allocated to large grants builders and initiaves through to the end of 2024. This leaves approximately 89k USD and 29.5 Ether unallocated and available to be rolled into the next term.

![](https://ipfs.punkscape.xyz/ipfs/bafkreigv5qvxcs7u7hhoj3lrwzp2hsikjasugtuwe7bepobjz6bhvg5nby)

**Note #1:** To ensure grantees have consistency, the funds requested for this category carry the program to Q3 which is an exception from the other spending categories which plan only through April 2025.

**Note #2:** The PG Working group budget request is in USDC only; our balance of ETH will rollover to next term, but it will be left to future stewards discretion to swap it, keep it or return it to the treasury.

![](https://ipfs.punkscape.xyz/ipfs/bafkreihplgibqq5zdwvy7eqksvue753a76tmtpkvicitirfazle3wpbyy4)

Subtracting the 89k available to rollover from 2024, the unmet need is 226k USDC which is the sum total to be included as the specification of this funding request.

## Spending Categories Explained

### Builder Grants

This new category consolidates the existing Large and Small grants under one category and program title. The Public Good working group has been working with a provider to create a unified platform which will be announced during frENSday in Bangkok on 11/11/2024. To ensure grantees have consistency, the funds requested for this category carry the program through to Q3 which is an exception from the other spending categories which plan through to April 2025.

- **Small Grants**  
  Multiple micro-grants will be distributed to builders via the Builder Grants platform to be launched. We have added the amount expected to spend in the next 5 months with the same amounts distributed in the last rounds.

- **Large Grants**  
  Grants up to 50k USDC with applications accepted on a rolling basis throughout the term. Large Grants will continue in Q4. The working group will continue to focus on strengthening impact measurements accomplished by grantees during the previous Large Grants cycle.

### PG Perpetual Bounty

Launched during ETHLondon in March 2024, this is a perpetual pool of funds that is available to builders who are developing projects which align with the principles of public goods in the web3 space.

This funding pool is available at any time, but also marketed specifically towards builders who are not eligible for ENS-related bounties during hackthons, but deserve support for their public goods mission.

### Events and Hackathons

The working group provides support to Public Goods events and hackathons. These funds cover expenses related to event sponsorship, bounties, judging and other participatory support roles during events.

**The current earmarked events are:**

- ETHGlobal Bangkok
- Devcon
- ETHDenver 2025

\*This list is not set as several events are still in planning stages for Q1 of 2025. The PG stewards continuously assess opportunities for expanding the public goods conversation and collaborations.

### Discretionary

The funds in this category are reserved for additional grant opportunities and expenses that arise during the term. Spending in this category is at the discretion of the working group stewards.

## Abstract

The Name Wrapper's upgrade mechanism contains a vulnerability whereby a malicious DAO could use the upgrade mechanism to seize control of wrapped names without the owner's consent, documented [here](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/security-advisory-a-malicious-dao-update-could-reduce-the-registration-duration-of-registered-eth-2lds/17576/1).

Since the v2 migration plan makes the upgrade mechanism obsolete, we now know the mechanism will never be required. This EP proposes to remove the DAO's ability to upgrade the name wrapper.

## Specification

Admin control over the name wrapper gives the DAO two functions: it can set the upgrade contract, and it can specify the address of the metadata contract. Since we want to remove the former ability while preserving the latter, we propose the following sequence of actions:

1. Deploy a new metadata contract, identical to the current one but using a proxy. The proxy instance should be owned by the DAO to provide for future metadata upgrades.
2. Update the name wrapper to reference the new metadata contract instead of the old one.
3. Revoke admin ownership over the name wrapper.

A new metadata service has been deployed at 0x806f84F3789f51352C1B0aB3fFa192665d283808, and a transparent proxy was deployed in transaction 0xd0aca1f2efb2db5e3d494649004e341decb2e94a1f30e94f301b6626702ee4c8, at address 0xabb76d7e79de010117b147761013f11630a6799f, with the initial implementation set to the above address, and the owner set to wallet.ensdao.eth. The admin contract for this proxy is at 0xeae9309ddb1aadb4cf1ebad5e51aef999833a992.

The executable component of this proposal sets the metadata service address on the name wrapper to the above proxy, then revokes ownership over it.

_Note: This was previously numbered EP11._

## Abstract

The $ENS airdrop can be terminated at any time on or after May 4, 2022 by a call from the DAO, transferring remaining tokens to an address it specifies. The EP2 airdrop can be terminated at any time by revoking the token approval given to it by the DAO. This EP proposes to execute both of these actions on or shortly after May 4, 2022.

## Specification

- Call 'sweep' on the ENS token contract, specifying the DAO wallet as target address.
- Call 'approve' on the ENS token contract, specifying the EP2 airdrop contract and an allowance of 0.

## Abstract

This is a vote to approve [ENSIP-15: Normalization Standard.](https://docs.ens.domains/ens-improvement-proposals/ensip-15-normalization-standard)

## Motivation

### EP3.7 Motivation

- Normalization isn't enforced on-chain.
- There is no code for the DAO to execute.
- Approval for ENSIP-15 should be confirmed through a social vote.

### ENSIP-15 Motivation

- Since [ENSIP-1](https://github.com/ensdomains/governance-docs/blob/8e2e6c98198dd31fd2e982987e286fd6ce540319/governance-proposals/ensip-1-ens.md) (originally [EIP-137](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-137)) was finalized in 2016, Unicode has [evolved](https://unicode.org/history/publicationdates.html) from version 8.0.0 to 15.0.0 and incorporated many new characters, including complex emoji sequences.
- ENSIP-1 does not state the version of Unicode.
- ENSIP-1 implies but does not state an explicit flavor of IDNA processing.
- [UTS-46](https://unicode.org/reports/tr46/) is insufficient to normalize emoji sequences. Correct emoji processing is only possible with [UTS-51](https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr51/).
- Validation tests are needed to ensure implementation compliance.
- The success of ENS has encouraged spoofing via the following techniques:
  1. Insertion of zero-width characters.
  2. Using names which normalize differently between algorithms.
  3. Using names which appear differently between applications and devices.
  4. Substitution of confusable (look-alike) characters.
  5. Mixing incompatible scripts.

## Specification

- Replace [ENSIP-1 § Name Syntax](https://docs.ens.domains/ens-improvement-proposals/ensip-1-ens#name-syntax) "UTS-46 algorithm" with link to [ENSIP-15](https://docs.ens.domains/ens-improvement-proposals/ensip-15-normalization-standard).
- Agree to normalize names according to ENSIP-15 for a safer end-user experience.
  - Examples:
    1. ![](https://i.imgur.com/VDOnxXe.png)
    1. ![](https://i.imgur.com/tWDRp8H.png)
    1. ![](https://i.imgur.com/OYIigpp.png)
  - Libraries implementing ENSIP-15:
    1. Javascript — [adraffy/ens-normalize](https://github.com/adraffy/ens-normalize.js)
    2. Javascript — [ensdomains/eth-ens-namehash](https://github.com/ensdomains/eth-ens-namehash)
    3. Python — [namehash/ens-normalize-python](https://github.com/namehash/ens-normalize-python)
  - Web Frameworks using ENSIP-15:
    1. Javascript — [ethers/ethers.io](https://github.com/ethers-io/ethers.js/)
    2. Javascript — [web3/web3.js](https://github.com/web3/web3.js)
    3. Javascript — [wagmi-dev/viem](https://github.com/wagmi-dev/viem)
- Names visible to the end-user should be [**beautified**](https://docs.ens.domains/ens-improvement-proposals/ensip-15-normalization-standard#annex-beautification) for a more consistent appearance.
  - Example: These labels are the same:\
    [![](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/1b7b4f3d0baa83d62415760a4622955e6de1f8f102a8ea5070e21ae0d44ab9ea/68747470733a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f703772785572452e706e67)](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/1b7b4f3d0baa83d62415760a4622955e6de1f8f102a8ea5070e21ae0d44ab9ea/68747470733a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f703772785572452e706e67)

## Voting

This vote is a single choice vote. You may vote for one of the following options:

- **For**
- **Against**
- **Abstain**

By voting **For** this proposal, you are voting in favor of approving [ENSIP-15](https://docs.ens.domains/ens-improvement-proposals/ensip-15-normalization-standard).

## Abstract

The ENS Ecosystem Working Group requests funding of 836,000 USDC to support operations through April 2025. This is the only funding request of Term 5.

The ENS Ecosystem Working Group is responsible for growing and improving the ENS Ecosystem by funding builders and projects that are ENS-specific or ENS-centric.

This social proposal is submitted to satisfy the requirements set out in Rule 10.1.1 of the Working Group Rules ([EP 1.8](https://docs.ens.domains/v/governance/governance-proposals/term-1/ep12-working-group-rules)). If this proposal is passed, the funding request will be included in a collective executable proposal put forward by all three Working Groups.

_Note: This was previously numbered EP6.2._

## Summary

This proposal is for the election of a new Director of the ENS Foundation.

## Abstract

This social proposal puts forth a vote for the election of a new Director of the ENS foundation.

This is a **contingent proposal** that will only be ratified if [\[EP6.1\] \[Social\] Removal of Brantly Millegan as Director of The ENS Foundation](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/ep-6-1-social-removal-of-brantly-millegan-as-director-of-the-ens-foundation/11092) determines that Brantly Millegan shall be removed from the directorship of the Foundation Company.

**Contingency:** If majority "No" is voted on [\[EP6.1\] \[Social\] Removal of Brantly Millegan as Director of The ENS Foundation](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/ep-6-1-social-removal-of-brantly-millegan-as-director-of-the-ens-foundation/11092), this proposal shall be null and void.

## Motivation

By a vote of the council, Brantly Millegan was removed as a director of the Foundation Company., the DAO shall decide whether Brantly Millegan is deemed capable, or otherwise, of continuing his role as the Director of the Ethereum Foundation, and to appoint a suitable replacement if he is deems incapable.

A timeline of events that led to this proposal has been posted by Community WG Stewards in another post [here](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/ens-dao-next-steps-re-brantly/10424/15) and quoted below:

> In May 2016, Brantly Millegan tweeted that, "Homosexual acts are evil. Transgenderism doesn't exist. Abortion is murder. Contraception is a perversion. So is masturbation and porn."
>
> On February 5th, 2022, brantly.eth, well-known as a prominent representative of the ENS protocol, [defended these views in a publicly held Twitter space](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ljrp0vjibawuufr/Brantly%20ENS.mp4?dl=0).
>
> Irrespective of one's personal beliefs, we, as ENS DAO Community Stewards, must set the example for inclusivity and must not divide our community.
>
> Propagating rhetoric that is viewed as hateful and discriminatory is not conduct conducive to the role as a Community Steward. This conduct will not be tolerated despite one's contributions to the protocol.

## Specification

The appointment of the incoming Director will be held by a [ranked choice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranked_voting) Snapshot vote from a list of pre-determined nominees. Additionally, there shall be an option for voters to select "None of the above" or abstain from this vote.

**Draft Ranked Choice Snapshot Vote**

> Who should be elected as the new Director of the ENS Foundation?
>
> **Choice 1:** [avsa.eth](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/nominations-for-ens-foundation-director-to-replace-brantly-eth/10634/12)
>
> **Choice 2:** [daylon.eth](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/nominations-for-ens-foundation-director-to-replace-brantly-eth/10634/9)
>
> **Choice 3:** [healingvisions.eth](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/nominations-for-ens-foundation-director-to-replace-brantly-eth/10634/3)
>
> **Choice 4:** None of the above.
>
> **Choice 5:** Abstain.

**Note:** \*This list was randomized by @berrios.eth.

The nomination process for this appointment can be found [here](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/nominations-for-ens-foundation-director-to-replace-brantly-eth/10634), and a summary of Director's roles, responsibilities, compensation and liabilities can be found [here](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/role-responsibilities-of-ens-foundation-director/10632).

## Notice to The ENS Foundation

In line with this proposal, a formal notice is served to the ENS Foundation as follows:

_"Pursuant to Article 15 of the Articles of Association, the council, hereby, gives notice to the Foundation Company of the appointment of a director of the Foundation Company, to serve pursuant to the terms of its Articles._

_Whereas, the council undertook a vote, via Snapshot, to remove Brantly Millegan,_

_Whereas, the majority of votes cast was to remove Brantly MIllegan and formal Notice given to the Foundation Company of such result,_

_Whereas, the council undertook a second vote, via Snapshot, from among nominees of the council, to appoint a new director of the Foundation Company;_

_Wherefore, the person, if any, with the highest number of votes cast is hereby appointed a director of the Foundation Company._

_The results to be formally noted in the council records and the name of such person, if there be one, shall be promptly communicated to the Foundation Company without further process."_

## Abstract

Following the successful passing of the [EP5.7](https://snapshot.org/#/ens.eth/proposal/0xf3a4673fe04a3ecfed4a2f066f6ced1539a5466d61630428333360b843653c54), this proposal aims to confirm the 8 individuals who will form the Security Council with the permissions defined in [EP5.7](https://snapshot.org/#/ens.eth/proposal/0xf3a4673fe04a3ecfed4a2f066f6ced1539a5466d61630428333360b843653c54). The Security Council will be responsible for protecting the organization from potential governance attacks by having the ability to cancel malicious proposals using the [SecurityCouncil](https://github.com/blockful-io/security-council-ens/blob/main/README.md) smart contract.

## Specification

A discussion was held in the ENS forum titled **[[Temp Check] Enable CANCEL role on the DAO](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/temp-check-enable-cancel-role-on-the-dao/19090)**.
Following that discussion, The [EP5.7](https://snapshot.org/#/ens.eth/proposal/0xf3a4673fe04a3ecfed4a2f066f6ced1539a5466d61630428333360b843653c54) proposal, which can be [found here](https://snapshot.org/#/ens.eth/proposal/0xf3a4673fe04a3ecfed4a2f066f6ced1539a5466d61630428333360b843653c54), detailed the need for a Security Council to mitigate the risk of governance attacks on the ENS DAO. The proposal passed with overwhelming support from the community, receiving 1.4 million votes and 100% approval.

As outlined in the [EP5.7](https://snapshot.org/#/ens.eth/proposal/0xf3a4673fe04a3ecfed4a2f066f6ced1539a5466d61630428333360b843653c54) proposal, the [SecurityCouncil](https://github.com/blockful-io/security-council-ens/blob/main/README.md) smart contract will be deployed, and the Security Council multisig will be granted the PROPOSER_ROLE in the timelock. This will allow the Security Council to cancel malicious proposals, without granting the ability to initiate proposals, vote on proposals, or perform any other actions. The contract also features an expiration mechanism that automatically revokes the council's veto power after 2 years, promoting decentralization.

### Proposed Security Council Members

The proposed Security Council will consist of the following 8 individuals in a 4/8 multisig configuration:

1. [nick.eth](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/ens/delegate/nick.eth)
2. [griff.eth](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/ens/delegate/0x839395e20bbb182fa440d08f850e6c7a8f6f0780)
3. [avsa.eth](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/ens/delegate/avsa.eth)
4. [lefteris.eth](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/ens/delegate/lefteris.eth)
5. [katherineykwu.eth](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/ens/delegate/katherineykwu.eth)
6. [fireeyes.eth](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/ens/delegate/fireeyesdao.eth)
7. [brantly.eth](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/ens/delegate/brantly.eth)
8. [alextnetto.eth](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/ens/delegate/alextnetto.eth)

The text of [EP5.7](https://snapshot.org/#/ens.eth/proposal/0xf3a4673fe04a3ecfed4a2f066f6ced1539a5466d61630428333360b843653c54) specified that the 5 delegates included on the veto contract would be included in the security council. To fill the remaining 3 places on the council, consideration was given to, delegation power, past activity in governance, economic skin on the game, and jurisdictional diversity (for legal reasons).

### Voting

This social proposal seeks to confirm the complete list of 8 individuals as the Security Council members. **The vote will be a simple For/Against/Abstain vote on the entire list.** If the proposal is successful, a separate executable proposal will be put forward to deploy the SecurityCouncil smart contract and grant the necessary roles.

For this vote, the 8 proposed members of the Security Council will vote "**Abstain**" to help meet quorum requirements while preserving their impartiality.

### Next Steps

Upon confirmation of the Security Council members through this social proposal, the following steps will be taken:

1. The SecurityCouncil contract will be manually deployed to Mainnet.
2. A multsig will be manually created with the 8 members as signers.
3. The multisig will accept ownership of the SecurityCouncil contract.
4. The executable proposal will grant the PROPOSER_ROLE to the SecurityCouncil contract address using the grantRole function in the timelock.

Once the executable proposal is passed and the contract is deployed with the necessary roles granted, the Security Council will be able to cancel malicious proposals to protect the ENS DAO.

After the specified expiration period (2 years), anyone can revoke the PROPOSER_ROLE from the Security Council, ensuring this is a time-limited mechanism that defaults back to a more decentralized posture.

## Success Criteria

For this social proposal to pass, the following quorum and voting requirements must be met:

1. **Quorum**: The proposal must receive a minimum of 1% of the total supply of $ENS (1 million votes) in the form of "Yes" and "Abstain" votes combined. "No" votes do not count towards quorum.

2. **Approval**: Once the quorum is reached, the proposal requires a simple majority (>50%) of "Yes" votes among the "Yes" and "No" votes to pass. "Abstain" votes do not count towards the approval calculation.

## Abstract

The primary mission of ENS DAO is to govern the protocol and allocate resources from the treasury in line with the DAO's constitution and broader objectives. However, due to changing economic dynamics, the DAO is increasingly vulnerable to attacks aimed at draining its treasury.

To safeguard the DAO's integrity and longevity, a Security Council with the authority to cancel malicious proposals is needed. To avoid perpetuating centralized power, the Security Council's authority will have a built-in expiration date. After two years, anyone will be able to call a [function](https://github.com/blockful-io/security-council-ens/blob/main/src/SecurityCouncil.sol#L59) that revokes the council's power to veto proposals, ensuring a time-limited mechanism to counter malicious attacks while promoting more delegation and governance distribution.

![security-council-diagram](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/BJb0bHP_A.png)

## Motivation

As ENS continues to grow, its treasury in ETH is always growing. Simultaneously, the percentage of tokens actively delegated is on the decline.

This imbalance creates a risk where an attacker could acquire enough $ENS to gain control of the DAO at a cost lower than the treasury's total value. This has been a growing concern since March 2023.

Past attacks on DAOs have exploited similar vulnerabilities, with some [being thwarted](https://x.com/AragonProject/status/1656028382939815937) by components with veto power. Currently, the ENS governance process involves a proposal passing through the governor, relying on delegated voting power for approval. If approved, the governor queues the proposal in a timelock contract, delaying execution by two days. While the governor can cancel proposals, it follows the same pathway as a malicious proposal, introducing potential risks.

The short-term solution was delegating 3.8M $ENS to a contract that can only vote "Against"; more details about this can be found in [Nick's forum post](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/introducing-veto-ensdao-eth/19088). The attack is still profitable and, depending on market conditions can be up to a 3x ROI, like in Dec 2023. We need a **mid-term solution** to cancel the attack, which is this proposal. An article about this research done by the Blockful team will be published [here](https://blockful.io/blog/ens-security-council) after the proposal is executed and there is no attack risk.

## Specification

To enhance security, the [SecurityCouncil contract](https://github.com/blockful-io/security-council-ens/blob/main/src/SecurityCouncil.sol) will be deployed, receiving the PROPOSER_ROLE in the timelock, granting it the ability to cancel proposals (callable only by the [Security Council multisig](https://etherscan.io/address/0xaa5cd05f6b62c3af58ae9c4f3f7a2acc2cdc2cc7)) without the power to initiate or modify other DAO actions. **The scope of this proposal is to assign the PROPOSER_ROLE to the SecurityCouncil contract ([Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/address/0xb8fa0ce3f91f41c5292d07475b445c35ddf63ee0#code))**.

To ensure decentralization, the contract will also feature a time-based expiration mechanism that allows anyone to revoke the PROPOSER_ROLE after two years. This window provides time to strengthen delegation and address current vulnerabilities, facilitating the DAO's transition to a more secure governance scenario.

## Security considerations

Assigning the PROPOSER_ROLE to a multisig within the timelock contract is overly broad for our requirements as it allows the address to create operations in the timelock. If the multisig signers are compromised, they could potentially propose and execute malicious changes. Therefore our approach is deploying a new contract similar to the current veto.ensdao.eth contract, which can only do one action: to CANCEL a transaction in the timelock, triggered only by the security council multisig.

The risk is mitigated but one scenario remains: if the whole multisig is compromised then a malicious entity could kick other signers and effectively stop the DAO from executing proposals by canceling all transactions, including any that would remove this contract from the PROPOSER_ROLE. Anyways, after 2 years, [anyone can remove the PROPOSER_ROLE from the contract](https://github.com/blockful-io/security-council-ens/blob/main/src/SecurityCouncil.sol#L59).

## Council Operations

It is in the best interest of everyone to make clear the expectations and responsibilities ENS DAO put on those members, backed by the reputation, other roles and gains those might have in the organization.

The security council is expected to act only in emergency, in the given following situations or similar cases:

- If a proposal goes against the ENS constitution

- If a proposal is approved with malicious intent against the DAO longevity/sustainability

- If such proposal is approved by any group of voters, but directly financially incentivised to vote against the DAOs interests to preserve their own financial stake.

- If any approved proposal goes directly against the DAO for the sole benefit of an attacker.

## Abstract

This proposal initiates a transfer of 117 ETH to the Meta-Governance Working Group to facilitate the refunding of .eth names invalidated by ENSIP-15, the latest ENS name normalization standard.

## Specification

ENSIP-15 introduced a new ENS name normalization standard, resulting in the invalidation of a set of .eth names. In order to address the impact on owners of these invalidated names, refund amounts have been determined based on the following factors:

1. Remaining registration fee or renewal fee
2. Gas fees paid to register the name
3. Any premium protocol fee paid to acquire the names

These factors together have been used to calculate the refund amounts. A total of 2,973 unique addresses will be refunded a total of approximately 115 ETH.

Note: The data is from June 18, 2023 when ENSIP-15 passed. The [distributions](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JoLq8obUwFu_xGaXRMslAyX6nwR3njXqIc7I9sizTLU/edit?usp=sharing) and [code](https://github.com/ensdomains/normalise-refund) are both open source.

To facilitate the transfer of refunds to the affected addresses, this proposal suggests transferring the necessary ETH amount, including gas fees, to the Meta-Governance multisig. The multisig will then execute the refunds on behalf of the ENS DAO and return any leftover gas funds, if applicable.

## Summary

We are requesting funding from the ENS DAO to build a production network of gateways. These gateways will support the rollout of reverse resolution for **Arbitrum, Base, Linea, Optimism, and Scroll.** We also plan to continue our research and development on the ENS protocol and actively contribute to the ENS ecosystem with a focus on resolving names from L2s. Our funding request focuses on infrastructure, talent acquisition and retention, and ongoing development to sustain this critical ENS infrastructure.

## Request

We are requesting **$1,200,000 USDC annually and 24,000 ENS tokens (vested over 2 years with a one year cliff).**

This request gives consideration to the feedback on our [Temp Check](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/temp-check-ep-x-x-funding-request-for-unruggable-to-build-and-operate-a-network-of-gateways-supporting-the-rollout-of-ensip-19-evm-chain-reverse-resolution/19902) on the ENS DAO forum.

## Executable Code

This proposal constitutes two streams:

- A stream of **$1,200,000 USDC** **per year** (12 months).
- A stream of **24,000 ENS** tokens over **2 years** (24 months) with a **1 year cliff** (12 months).

Both streams are controlled directly by the ENS DAO Wallet. They can be cancelled at any time with a DAO vote should Unruggable not fulfil their promises.

## Abstract

First tranche to fund the Endowment with 16,000 ETH sent from [ENS DAO](https://etherscan.io/address/0xfe89cc7abb2c4183683ab71653c4cdc9b02d44b7) to the [ENS Endowment](https://etherscan.io/address/0x4F2083f5fBede34C2714aFfb3105539775f7FE64) and an additional 150 ETH sent to the [Meta-Gov Pod](https://etherscan.io/address/0x91c32893216dE3eA0a55ABb9851f581d4503d39b) to account for karpatkey and Steakhouse monthly fees.

## Motivation

[Approximately one year ago](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/an-ens-endaoment/11756), the ENS DAO initiated a process to ensure the sustainability of ENS as a self-funded public good for the long term. The [RFP process](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/ep2-2-4-social-rfp-ens-endowment/14069) (EP2.2.4), on which [karpatkey, together with Steakhouse, made a proposal](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/updated-endaoment-proposal-karpatkey-steakhouse-financial/14799), resulted in the [selection of karpatkey](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/social-ep2-2-5-selection-of-an-ens-endowment-fund-manager/15188) (EP2.2.5).

For reference, the proposal submitted by karpatkey was for an initial size of \$52,000,000 USD (converted to 32,000 ETH for operational purposes as the Endowment will be founded in ETH and to account for the reduction of the pool according to [EP3.3](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/ep3-3-executable-sell-eth-into-usdc/15906)). The proposal included performance fees of 10% above the investment's reference currency, with $ for $-related investments and ETH for ETH-related investments, as well as an annual fee of 0.5% based on the size of the endowment, payable entirely in ETH on a monthly basis.

Karpatkey engaged in discussions with the ENS community to seek feedback on strategies and the ramp-up process, both [here](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/social-endowment-initial-conditions-required-steps/15684) and [here](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/endowment-initiation/15952). Feedback was received regarding concerns about the required time to establish trust and the need to limit executive votes for funding. Karpatkey believes that a balanced approach, such as funding 50% on day one and the remaining 50% after six months, would be a suitable tradeoff for all parties. To address questions and concerns raised, a [FAQ](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/endowment-frequently-asked-questions-faq/16228) was provided.

In the meantime, karpatkey made progress on the setup of [the Endowment safe](https://etherscan.io/address/0x4F2083f5fBede34C2714aFfb3105539775f7FE64), which has been seeded to display target positions. The necessary [managing permissions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11xrliJIveXO6C6twYOrnGJ5QUW0Apr1LCcDY8hOfpuo/edit) have been defined and audits from [Ackee](https://github.com/gnosis/zodiac-modifier-roles/blob/main/packages/evm/docs/ZodiacModifierRolesJanuary2023abch.pdf) and [Sub 7](https://github.com/gnosis/zodiac-modifier-roles/blob/main/packages/evm/docs/ZodiacModifierRolesJanuary2023sub7.pdf) have been completed. On its part, Steakhouse has started work on providing open source [accounting and financial services](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xS4nXx1G0QCjFS-VdG5yVmVoMa5t1q9_dFZ9N4wGSJ8/edit?usp=sharing), as well as a [monitoring Dune dashboard](https://dune.com/steakhouse/ens-steakhouse), both of which are work in progress.

If the Endowment is funded through this first tranche, karpatkey will allocate the funds as follows:

## Abstract

The ENS Public Goods Working Group requests funding to **support operations until the September 2024 funding window**.

The Public Goods working group funds projects and builders improving the Web3 ecosystems. This funding stream is authorized in [Article III](https://docs.ens.domains/dao/constitution#iii-income-funds-ens-and-other-public-goods) of the ENS DAO Constitution. This funding supports initiatives related to open-source software, tooling, research, and any practical implementations that broadly benefit a wide range of users of Ethereum and Web3.

This social proposal is submitted to satisfy the requirements set out in Rule 10.1.1 of the Working Group Rules ([EP 1.8](https://docs.ens.domains/v/governance/governance-proposals/term-1/ep12-working-group-rules)) and further required by [this snapshot proposal in Nov. 2023 modifying steward rules](https://snapshot.org/#/ens.eth/proposal/0x26a5c8dec547837495707e70446d1e7cd874a91f75753c602998f6e70083a266). If this proposal is passed, the funding request will be included in a collective executable proposal put forward by all three Working Groups.

## Specification

The balance of the Public Goods multisig at the time of Snapshot contained 147.2k USDC and 33.5 ETH.

If passed, this proposal will transfer 450.3k USDC and 21.5 ETH from the DAO wallet to the Public Goods working group to accommodate the proposed budget below.

### Balances (March 2024)\*

| **USDC** | **ETH** | **ENS** |

## Description of Initiatives

### Large Grants

Grants up to 50k USDC with applications accepted on a rolling basis throughout the year-long term. Large Grants will resume in Q2. With five grantees completing milestones from last term, the budget includes remaining payouts yet to be disbursed. We plan to add at least two more grantees during Q2 while piloting new grants management software. In the second half of the year, we will run another full-size round supporting up to 10 grantees at a time with a 200k USD total prize pool.

### Small Grants

Multiple micro-grants voted on by the community. Small Grants will resume during the first half of the year shortly after ETHDenver. We have added the amount expected to spend through the end of the year with no increase from last term. This is approximately 12.5 ETH per quarter. With market fluctuations, stewards may right-size and lower the amounts distributed during round.

### Events and Hackathons

The working group will support Public Goods events and hackathons. Funds have included expenses related to the funding of hackathons, events, and related participation in events (judging, panels, speaking) where necessary.

The current earmarked events are:

- [ETHGuatemala](https://ethereum.gt/)
- [EthLatam](https://ethlatam.org/)
- [ETHGlobal London](https://ethglobal.com/events/london2024)
- [ETHCanal](https://www.ethcanal.xyz/)
- [ETHCC](https://ethcc.io/)
- [ETHGlobal Brussels](https://ethglobal.com/events/brussels)
- [DAO Tokyo](https://dao-tokyo.xyz/)
- [ETHGlobal San Francisco](https://ethglobal.com/events/sanfrancisco2024)
- [ETHGlobal Bangkok](https://ethglobal.com/events/bangkok)
- [Devcon](https://devcon.org/en/)

This list is not guaranteed as several events are still in the planning stages. The PG stewards will continuously assess opportunities to expand the public goods conversation and collaborations.

### Discretionary

The funds in this initiative are reserved for additional grant opportunities and expenses that arise during the term. Spending on this initiative is at the discretion of the working group stewards.

## Abstract

This is a vote to elect a new director of the ENS Foundation.

## Motivation

Brantly Millegan has [communicated](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/resignation-from-the-ens-foundation-effective-upon-the-election-of-a-replacement/16676) that he would like to resign as a director of the ENS Foundation. Brantly's resignation will take effect following the appointment of a new director by the DAO.

The DAO may appoint a new director of the ENS Foundation pursuant to Article 15 of the Articles of Association of the ENS Foundation.

## Specification

The DAO will vote to appoint one new director of the ENS Foundation.

Two candidates are seeking election after successfully completing the requirements outlined in the ['Call for Nominees' post](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/call-for-nominees-ens-foundation-director/16858) on the ENS Governance forum.

The candidates seeking election are:

1. Sean Murray
2. Alex Van de Sande

The candidate with the highest number of votes above quorum will be appointed as a director of the ENS Foundation following the completion of mandatory KYC checks.

### Voting

This vote is a single choice vote. You may vote for one of the following options:

1. Sean Murray
2. Alex Van de Sande
3. None of the above
4. Abstain

By voting for a named candidate, you are voting in favor of appointing that candidate as a director of the ENS Foundation.

## Candidates

### Sean Murray

**Twitter**: [@financeguy74](https://twitter.com/financeguy74) \
**Are you 18 years of age or older?** Yes \
**Are you a U.S citizen or permanent resident?** Yes \
**Do you live in the U.S or one of its territories?** Yes

**Why should you be appointed as a director of the ENS Foundation?** \
I am capable of fulfilling the required duties but also beyond that I would use it as a platform to increase mainstream ENS adoption.

**How would you handle a request from the SEC for information about the ENS Foundation and/or the $ENS token?** \
This is an incomplete question because it does not specify who "you" is. If an SEC inquiry is addressed only to the Foundation itself, the correct answer is that the Foundation retain counsel and that counsel manage the inquiry. Should the definition of "you" be more broad, then any rational person should find my conditions stated below rational, reasonable, and necessary. They should be put in place regardless of who is chosen.

**Is there any other information you would like delegates to know about you or your nomination?** \
Yes, if by chance I am selected, my acceptance of the role is conditional on:

- The DAO authorizing the Foundation to set up D\&O insurance;
- The DAO authorizing the Foundation to compensate directors.

### Alex Van de Sande

**Twitter**: [@avsa](https://twitter.com/avsa) \
**Are you 18 years of age or older?** Yes \
**Are you a U.S citizen or permanent resident?** No \
**Do you live in the U.S or one of its territories?** No

**Why should you be appointed as a director of the ENS Foundation?** \
I won't lie: I believe this role is purely ceremonial and believe that as long as everything is working as intended, Directors should do nothing but rubberstamp what the DAO approves. But as a symbol, I do think it's important for the Directors not to be all from ENS Labs, nor for them to be in any jurisdiction that is not welcome to Crypto - and at this moment, the US is such jurisdiction.

So that's it, that's the whole of my pitch: I do not work for ENS labs, I do not respond to them, nor do I am subject to US jurisdiction. I also have been in this space for the last 10 years and you can expect me to be around in the next 10 years.

**How would you handle a request from the SEC for information about the ENS Foundation and/or the $ENS token?** \
I am not not subject to American laws, but that doesn't mean I intend to break any of them, as I still intend to keep the privilege of landing in US soil. I still believe the US to be a reasonable thriving democracy that is just right now a bit on the wrong side of the pendulum. I also believe that the ENS airdrop was a great precedent on how to do token distribution to the community: no "investor" ever received it in the airdrop, because there were no investors in ENS before the airdrop. All that received them were either involved in the community or the development.

If I ever received a request from the SEC of any other legal institutions from anywhere I would take the reasonable route: talk to my lawyer, open it with as much as possible with the community and, in an extreme case in which I believed I the requests would hurt ENS and I couldn't be open to talk about it, I would resign from the foundation.

**Is there any other information you would like delegates to know about you or your nomination?** \
I am not Dutch either, despite a lot of people seemingly believing it so.

## Overview

The DAO is seeking a fund manager to manage an endowment fund. This fund will be established from some combination of current treasury and ongoing revenue, and will exist to insulate the DAO from economic fluctuations, ensuring it can continue its core operations regardless of the wider economic outlook.

Funds will be drawn from the DAO's general funds, currently held in ETH and USDC, as well as from ongoing DAO revenue until the fund reaches its target size. Proposals should outline how much of the DAO's current funds the intend to appropriate, as well as what proportion of ongoing revenue will be required, and for how long.

The DAO's accounting basis divides assets into earned and unearned income. Unearned income corresponds to funds paid for registrations and renewals that are future-dated; for example, if a user spends $100 to register a name for 20 years, after a year $5 of that will be counted as earned income and the remainder as unearned income.

Unearned income may be incorporated into the fund, but must be risk-neutral with regard to ETH. Earned income should be risk-netural with regard to USDC.

The DAO's current balances can be viewed [here](https://datastudio.google.com/reporting/8785928a-71d5-4b17-9fea-fe1c937b064f); as of this writing they are:

- 13,069 ETH (\~$20M) in earned income
- $3,817,067 USDC
- 18,184 ETH (\~$20M) in unearned income

## Scope of Work

1. Expand the endowment structure specified in the accepted proposal into an executable form.
2. Work with the ENS Meta-Governance stewards to refine the proposal.
3. Implement the proposal onchain.
4. Administer and adjust the endowment as necessary on an ongoing basis.

## Selection Criteria

The endowment will need to be able to sustain annual withdrawals of at least $4M USDC without a long-term reduction in principal.

Proposals should include, at a minimum:

1. Intended high-level fund allocation of the endowment.
2. Initial and target size for the endowment fund, including the proportion of funds sourced from earned and unearned income.
3. How incoming revenues and income will be assigned to the fund.
4. Specific information on how the fund will be managed, and what steps will be taken to minimise custodial risk.
5. A fee schedule for the fund manager.
6. A detailed description of the reporting structures that will be put in place.

Priority will be given to proposals that:

- Minimise custodial risk by using onchain mechanisms that allow administration of the funds without the fund administrator having custody of the funds.
- Lay out a coherent strategy for how investment returns can be maintained in the short/medium/long term.
- Minimise capital risks relative to the expected returns.
- Define clear mechanisms for assessment and adjustment to changing external and internal conditions in order to continue to meet the endowment's objectives.
- Offer a high rate of return proportional to risk.
- Define a clear reporting structure for frequent and comprehensive reporting of the fund's status to the DAO.

## Abstract

This proposal introduces new actions and strategies to the Endowment with the aim of enhancing diversification and adapting to current market conditions. Notable additions include ETH-neutral strategies involving Liquid Staking Protocols and established Money Markets.

## Motivation

Following the successful approval of [E.P. 4.2](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/ens/proposal/10686228418271748393758532071249002330319730525037728746406757788787068261444), the second tranche of the Endowment was funded with 16,000 ETH. Community feedback during the E.P. 4.2 voting window indicated a desire to reduce exposure to Lido due to concerns about centralization risks in the network. While diversifying ETH-neutral holdings was already underway, the need for further diversification and divestment from Lido became clear during [community discussions](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/4-2-executable-fund-the-endowment-second-tranche/17743) and the last [Meta-gov call](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/metagov-working-group-weekly-meeting-11am-et-tuesday/15981/43#h-2-endowment-discussion-karpatkey-steakhouse-10) before the vote's closure. Consequently, karpatkey and @steakhouse proposed a 20% cap on Lido's maximum allocation within the ETH-neutral portfolio, set to be achieved by month-end. This proposal's goal is to introduce new strategies for deploying the remaining 80% of the funds as well as other minor maintenance actions.

## Specification

Permissions to be added in this proposal:

1. Deposit ETH on Compound v3;
2. Deposit ETH or WETH on AAVE v3;
3. Deposit ETH or WETH on Spark Protocol;
4. Stake (and unstake) ETH on Stader;
5. Stake (and unstake) ETH on Ankr;
6. Removal of CowSwap permissions;
7. Removal of SushiSwap permissions;
8. Addition of an alternative getReward() for Aura pools;
9. Swaps:
   1. rETH &lt;&gt; WETH on Balancer;
   2. rETH &lt;&gt; WETH on Uniswap v3;
   3. ankrETH &lt;&gt; wstETH on Balancer;
   4. ETHx &lt;&gt; WETH on Balancer;
   5. ankrETH &lt;&gt; ETH on Curve;
   6. ETHx &lt;&gt; WETH on Pancake Swap

### Auditing Process

We are releasing an updated version of the ["Preset Permissions - ENS Endowment"](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ker_TkBJV0xmQ9Li9HB-vtdlpx1vEeVEQwpIH6WoK0o/edit?usp=sharing) document, highlighting all permissions granted to karpatkey, with proposed additions marked in green and revocations in red. We encourage community members with technical expertise to review and provide feedback on the preset update [payload](https://gist.github.com/santinomics/5b43dee4839d74e2c593ac9e7c7d1d3d).

In the auditing realm, significant progress has been made, with a [new version](https://zodiac-roles-1h9v0miw9-gnosis-guild.vercel.app/gor%3A0x74F819Fa1D95B57a15ECDEf9ce5c779C1bD6cc8A/roles/test-role/diff/4Iq1jdNbLbCBKmLAKciGaDQANiHStkCqFvJJ5KWQc) of the Zodiac Roles Modifier app developed by Gnosis Guild. When fully operational, this app will allow users to input a payload and check the before-and-after status of permissions presets, enhancing the auditing process.

Furthermore, we're actively engaged in collaborative efforts with potential partners to create a user-friendly audit report, enhancing openness for all stakeholders involved in the process. In our commitment to transparency, we're taking an additional step by offering a [self-audit report](https://github.com/karpatkey/gists/blob/main/Self%20Audit_%20%5BENS%5D%20-%20PUR%20%233%20-%20New%20ETH-Neutral%20Strategies.md). This report sheds light on our internal procedures for assessing proposed permissions and changes, providing further insight into our practices.

_Note: This was previously numbered EP5._

## Summary

Increases the start price for the temporary premium added when names expire from $2,000 to $100,000.

## Abstract

When a name expires, it goes through a 90 day grace period, after which it becomes available for general registration. To prevent it becoming a race to register, a 'temporary premium' is attached, starting at $2000 and diminishing to 0 over 28 days. Done properly this results in a dutch auction for the name.

When the premium was set, $2000 was roughly the 98th percentile of all auction prices for the short name auction, and seemed like a reasonable starting price. Today, we're seeing multiple reports of names, particularly 3 character names, being snapped up by bots the moment they become available at the maximum premium.

Long-term we can improve the mechanism by setting the initial premium based on the base price of the name (so 3 letter names start off more expensive than 5+ letter names), and by introducing a nonlinear pricing curve (for example, having the price diminish by 1% per hour for 28 days). In the short term, however, I'd like to propose setting the initial premium to a much higher value, which we can do with a simple transaction from the DAO account.

Research of current trends shows:

- 2,798 names have been bought during the temporary premium period so far.
- Of these, 340 (12%) were purchased the moment they became available.
- Registrations of names during the temporary premium period have been on the increase since the DAO launched in November.
- 12 names have been purchased at a premium and flipped on OpenSea; the most valuable of these, punk.eth, went for $85,636.

Accordingly, I propose increasing the temporary premium from its current value of $2,000 to a new value of $100,000. This will ensure that the start price exceeds the secondary market resale value of almost all released domains, and corresponds to a rate of decrease of just under $150/hr, meaning that less valuable domains will still have a multi-hour period during which people can purchase them before the premium expires.

In parallel, work should be initiated on a new nonlinear premium model, so that high initial premiums can be combined with a slow decrease towards 0, allowing both high and low value names to be bid on fairly.

## Specification <a href="#specification-3" id="specification-3"></a>

1. Deploy a new instance of the `LinearPremiumPriceOracle` with the initial premium set to 100,000 USD and the period set to 28 days, with other pricing variables identical to the current oracle.
2. Call `setPriceOracle` on `controller.ens.eth`, passing in the address of the new price oracle contract.

| **Status**            | Superseded by [EP 6.5](/dao/proposals/6.5)                                                                               |

## Abstract

EP 6.3 was passed with a budget of $4.5M for 2025 on the 25th of February and pertains to Service Provider budgets and allocation mechanisms for 2025. After broad discussion between delegates, working groups and service providers, a proposed change to the voting process is now being presented for vote.

## Vote

This is a proposed amendment to the evaluation criteria for Service Providers. On April 1st there was an Delegate All Hands meeting in which many delegates expressed the desire to be able to fine tune their vote in order to express preference over not only the teams, but also their respective budgets. This was followed by extensive discussion between delegates, working groups and Service Providers, leading to the below amendment:

_The goal here is to propose a new rule change while keeping the same properties as having a single budget be decided in one simultaneous vote._

### Current Evaluation Process, as voted on snapshot

> **Evaluation Process**
>
> Projects are assessed in ranked order:
>
> - If \"None Below\" is reached, evaluation stops.
> - If the candidate has been part of the Service provider program for at least a year AND if the extended budget fits within the remaining two-year stream budget, assign to the two-year stream . Subtract the extended budget from the two-year stream budget.
> - Assign to the one-year stream if:
>   - The extended budget fits the one-year budget. Subtract its extended budget from the one-year stream.
>   - OR if the basic budget fits the one-year budget, subtract the its basic budget from the one-year stream.
>   - If none of these conditions are met, the project is eliminated.

### New proposed rule amendment

The vote will present both extended and basic budgets as separate options and a given voter can pick _either_ budget to rank their candidates. They do not need to rank both budget options separately, as they are considered the same candidate.

The rank of each candidate will be the rank of it's highest ranked budget option, according to a Copeland methodology (using average support as a tiebreaker). Then a pairwise comparison will be made between the two budget options and the preferred one will be set as its selected budget.

### Vote Processing Algorithm

1. **Votes Preprocessing**:

   - For providers with both basic and extended budget options, the algorithm enforces the lowest option to be ranked immediately after the highest option (of the same provider).
   - If a provider has only one budget option, no special enforcement is needed for that provider.
   - This grouping ensures accurate pairwise comparisons between different between different providers and then budget options from the same provider.

2. **Pairwise Comparisons (copeland)**:

   - For each pair of candidates (provider), we calculate the total voting power supporting each over the other.
   - A candidate wins a head-to-head matchup if the total voting power ranking them higher exceeds that of their opponent.
   - Each win contributes 1 point to a candidate's Copeland score.
   - The pairwise comparison between basic and extended must also be stored, for defining the preference on the budget.

3. **\"None Below\" Handling**:

   - The \"None Below\" option serves as a cutoff point in a voter's ranking.
   - Candidates ranked above \"None Below\" are considered ranked.
   - Candidates ranked below \"None Below\" are considered unranked by that voter.
   - A ranked candidate always wins against an unranked candidate in pairwise comparisons.

4. **Scoring and Ranking**:
   - Candidates are ranked by their Copeland score (descending), with average support as a tiebreaker.

### Allocation Process

1. **Budget Type Determination**:

   - Each provider's budget (basic or extended) is determined by their internal head-to-head match result.

2. **Stream Allocation**:

   - Candidates are processed in Copeland ranking order.
   - Candidates that are in top 5 and were selected in SPP1, are elegible for the 2-year stream.
   - All other candidates receive allocations from the 1-year stream.
   - From top to bottom, try to fit projects in the 2 year stream budget, and then on the 1-year stream budget using the standard knapsack algorithm, stopping once budgets are exhausted or None Below is reached.
   - If a service providers extended scope got a majority vote over basic scope and the extended scope doesn't fit into the remaining 1-year budget but the basic budget does, then the given service provider's basic budget is included.
   - If a candidate is ranked below \"None Below\", they're rejected regardless of budget availability.

3. **Budget Transfer Mechanism**:

   - After processing the top 5 candidates, any remaining 2-year budget transfers to the 1-year stream. Final 1-year budget = (Initial 1-year budget) + (Leftover 2-year budget).

4. **Rejection Criteria**:
   - A candidate is rejected if:
     - They're ranked below the \"None Below\" option
     - There's insufficient budget

## Updated Timelines

The initial proposal stated a submission deadline of March 31st, and vote to begin _soon_ after that.

This vote will be conducted over the next 5 days. Then, if the vote is successful MetaGov will be interfacing with voting UI teams to ensure sufficient testing and timelines before the final SPP vote. There will be a minimum of 3 days between this proposal closing and the start of the final vote, to allow Service Providers to update their proposals if necessary.

## Conclusion

If this amendment proposal passes, the MetaGov working group, delegates and governance UI providers will enact the updated proposal process.

We would like to thank everyone who has taken the time to be involved in this discussion and have been blown away by the level of engagement & productivity throughout.

_Note: This was previously numbered EP14._

## Abstract

True Names Ltd ("TNL") developed the Ethereum Name Service ("ENS") protocol, continues to manage the development of the ENS Protocol and solely focuses on this project. Incubated at the Ethereum Foundation in 2017, TNL spun out in 2018 with the charge of designing and deploying THE next generation naming service. TNL is now a growing team of web3 enthusiasts from across the globe working together to support the ENS Ecosystem that now has a passionate community that has registered over 1 million ENS names and uses more than 500 integrations.

In 2021, TNL initiated the creation of the ENS DAO with the goal of 1) furthering the development of the ENS Protocol and 2) funding public goods projects.

In consideration of the work completed thus far this calendar year and the work in the months and years to come, per Article III of the ENS Constitution, True Names Ltd respectfully requests an evergreen grant stream that will allow the organization to continue the development and improvement of the ENS Protocol. For Calendar Year 2022, this request will amount to $4,197,500 USDC which is equivalent to a daily stream of $11,500 USDC. In Q1 of each year, TNL or the ENS Dao may make requests to alter and/or terminate this evergreen grant stream.

## Specification

We request that the ENS DAO approve a daily grant of $11,500 USDC to True Names Ltd, backdated to January 1st, 2022.

This will be accomplished by approving a dedicated token streaming contract at `0xB1377e4f32e6746444970823D5506F98f5A04201` to spend USDC on behalf of the DAO.

_Note: This was previously numbered EP9._

## Abstract

In the past we deployed the Linear Premium Oracle as a way to create a distribution mechanism that did not involve gas auctions and bots. This was largely successful and those who wanted a recently expired name could participate in the dutch auction and not have to compete on gas or with bots. Recently with the popularity of ENS increasing, the demand and the price people are willing to pay for these premium names has increased. In response to this TNL quickly drafted a [short-term solution](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/ep5-executable-set-the-temporary-premium-start-price-to-100-000/9336) to raise the premium to 100k, which we felt was the upper limit for what a linear price decay curve could handle.

There are a couple reasons for this:

1. On a linear curve, if the price is too high the price decreases too fast and the UX is bad for a user who wants an exact price (especially at the lower end of the curve)
2. If you extend the time period out, the premium lasts for too long. E.g. If we made it 1 million USD and we wanted a similar price decay speed as 100k, we would need to run it for 10 months, which seems unreasonable.

We can see from the data below, even with the new 100k premium, we have already had a 5-7 domains go for maximum, or close to maximum premium. If a domain sells for the actual premium, it means the dutch auction is not doing its job and so we need to deploy a long-term solution for dealing with premium pricing.

The long-term solution would be to change the actual curve to something that could start at a very high price, would decrease rapidly at the beginning and slow down at the end so you have better UX for users. And therefore this proposal is to deploy an exponential price curve, that does exactly this. This would allow fairer bidding on both high and low priced names.

_Note: This was previously numbered EP6.1._

## Summary

The removal of Brantly Millegan as Director of The ENS Foundation (the "Foundation Company.").

Adapted from the original [EP6](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/ep6-cancelled-see-ep-6-1-and-6-2) Proposal.

## Abstract

This social proposal puts forth a vote to enact the possible removal of Brantly Millegan as the Director of the Foundation Company.

This action is justifiable under [Clause 15 of the Articles of Association of The ENS Foundation paragraph titled 'Directors'](https://464911102-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FVAbPWWNVJRvupIW5EOre%2Fuploads%2Fgit-blob-4b4ba71c3fe2a3146e9b1402d03ecb69d89c0913%2FM%26A%20-%20Incorp%20-%20The%20ENS%20Foundation%20-%2026%20October%202021.pdf?alt=media#page=9) which states that:

> The Council has the power, exercisable by notice to the Foundation Company, to appoint or remove one or more directors of the Foundation Company.

## Motivation

A timeline of events that led to this proposal has been posted by Community WG Stewards in another post [here](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/ens-dao-next-steps-re-brantly/10424/15) and quoted below:

> In May 2016, Brantly Millegan tweeted, "Homosexual acts are evil. Transgenderism doesn't exist. Abortion is murder. Contraception is a perversion. So is masturbation and porn."
>
> On February 5th, 2022, brantly.eth, well-known as a prominent representative of the ENS protocol, [defended these views in a publicly held Twitter space](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ljrp0vjibawuufr/Brantly%20ENS.mp4?dl=0).
>
> Irrespective of one's personal beliefs, we, as ENS DAO Community Stewards, must set the example for inclusivity and must divide our community.
>
> Propagating rhetoric that is viewed as hateful and discriminatory is not conduct conducive to the role as a Community Steward. This conduct will not be tolerated despite one's contributions to the protocol.

Through this Social Proposal, the DAO shall decide whether Brantly Millegan is deemed capable, or otherwise, of continuing his role as the Director of the Foundation Company, and to appoint a suitable replacement if he is deemed incapable.

## Specification

The removal of Brantly Millegan's directorship of the Foundation Company will be defined by a simple "Yes" or "No" vote with the option to abstain.

**Draft Snapshot Vote**

> Should Brantly Millegan be removed from directorship of the Foundation Company? **Choice 1:** Yes **Choice 2:** No **Choice 3:** Abstain

**If Majority "Yes:"** Brantly Millegan is voted to be removed and the results of [**\[EP6.2\] \[Social\] Election of a new Director of the ENS Foundation**](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/ep6-2-social-replacement-of-brantly-millegan-as-director-of-the-ens-foundation/11093) regarding Brantly Millegan's successor shall be effective immediately.

**If Majority "No:"** Brantly Millegan is voted to remain in a directorship position over the Foundation Company, the results of [**\[EP6.2\] \[Social\] Election of a new Director of the ENS Foundation**](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/ep6-2-social-replacement-of-brantly-millegan-as-director-of-the-ens-foundation/11093) shall be null and void.

## Notice to The ENS Foundation

In line with this proposal, a formal notice is served to the ENS Foundation as follows:

_"Pursuant to Article 15 of the Articles of Association, the council, hereby, gives notice to the Foundation Company of a vote to remove Brantly Millegan as a director of the Foundation Company._

_Whereas, the council undertook a vote, via Snapshot, to remove Brantly Millegan, as a director of the Foundation Company;_

_Whereas, by a majority of the votes cast is to remove Brantly Millegan, as a director of the Foundation Company;_

_Wherefore, Brantly Millegan is hereby removed as a director of The ENS Foundation and shall cease and desist all duties thereto._

_The result to be formally noted in the council records and shall be promptly communicated to the Foundation Company without further process._

_This Notice shall have no force or effect, if the vote to remove Brantly Millegan fails to obtain a majority of the votes cast."_

## Summary

This executable proposal seeks to implement the revised budget stream to ENS Labs develop, maintain and audit [ENSv2](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/ens-labs-development-proposal-ensv2-and-native-l2-support/19232). The motivation, justification, budget breakdown, and development plan was previously detailed in a [Temp Check](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/temp-check-ensv2-development-funding-request/19762) request.

## Background

With over 3 million .eth names and 20 million more ENS names registered by the likes of Coinbase, Uniswap, and Linea – ENS has become the standard for web3 identity. As Ethereum's roadmap evolves towards being rollup-centric, it's essential for ENS to adapt in parallel, ensuring it meets the needs of both the Ethereum ecosystem and its users.

To continue scaling and evolving ENS, ENS Labs is requesting an increase in its annual budget from $4.2M USDC to $9.7M USDC, and a one-time grant for future security audits of ENSv2. This revised funding is necessary for ENS Labs to develop, maintain, and audit ENSv2, a major upgrade that will enhance decentralization, flexibility, and scalability by leveraging Layer 2 solutions and redesigning the ENS protocol from the ground up.

# Process of Submitting a Proposal

## Passing a Proposal

### Types of Proposal

There are three main types of governance proposals you can make:

1. **[Executable Proposal](https://github.com/ensdomains/docs/tree/master/src/public/governance/executable-proposal-template.md):** This is a proposal for a series of smart contract operations to be executed by accounts the DAO controls. These can include transfers of tokens as well as arbitrary smart contract calls. Examples of this include allocating funding to a workstream multisig wallet, or upgrading an ENS core contract. Executable proposals have a quorum requirement of 1% and require a minimum approval of 50% to pass.
2. **[Social Proposal](https://github.com/ensdomains/docs/tree/master/src/public/governance/social-proposal-template.md)**: This is a proposal that asks for the agreement of the DAO on something that cannot be enforced onchain. Examples of this include a proposal to change the royalty percentage for the ENS secondary market on OpenSea, or a petition to the root keyholders. Social proposals have a quorum requirement of 1% and require a minimum approval of 50% to pass.
3. **[Constitutional Amendment](https://github.com/ensdomains/docs/tree/master/src/public/governance/constitutional-amendment-template.md)**: This is a social proposal that asks the DAO to amend the constitution. Your draft proposal should include a [diff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diff) showing the exact changes you propose to make to the constitution. Rules for amending the constitution are set in the constitution itself, and currently require a quorum of 1% and a minimum approval of two thirds to pass.

### **Phase 1: Temperature Check — Discourse**

The purpose of the Temperature Check is to determine if there is sufficient will to make changes to the status quo.

To create a Temperature Check, ask a general, non-biased question to the community on [discuss.ens.domains](https://discuss.ens.domains) about a potential change (example: "Should ENS decrease registration costs for 3-letter domains?"). Forum posts should be in the "DAO-wide -> Temperature Check" category.

Temperature checks are informal and optional; it's up to you to use the feedback to decide if you want to proceed further with your proposal.

### **Phase 2: Draft Proposal — GitHub**

The purpose of the Draft Proposal is to establish formal discussion around a potential proposal.

To create a Draft Proposal, [create a new governance proposal](https://github.com/ensdomains/governance-docs/new/main/governance-proposals) in the governance-docs repository on GitHub. Start by copying the template for an [executable proposal](https://github.com/ensdomains/docs/tree/master/src/public/governance/executable-proposal-template.md), [social proposal](https://github.com/ensdomains/docs/tree/master/src/public/governance/social-proposal-template.md), or [constitutional amendment](https://github.com/ensdomains/docs/tree/master/src/public/governance/constitutional-amendment-template.md), as appropriate. Once you have written your proposal, create a Draft Pull Request for it. Start a new post in the DAO-wide -> Draft Proposals" category with a link to the PR for discussion.

Reach out to your network to build support for the proposal. Discuss the proposal and solicit delegates to provide feedback on it. Be willing to respond to questions on the Draft Proposal topic and in comments on the pull request. Share your viewpoint, although try to remain as impartial as possible.

If your proposal is an executable proposal, you will need to specify the actions your proposal will take while it is in draft stage. You may wish to wait until the proposal is stable before doing this. The executable proposal template explains how to do this.

If your proposal is a constitutional amendment, you will need to produce a diff showing the exact changes you are proposing to make. The easiest way to do this is to go to the [constitution](/dao/constitution), click "Edit on GitHub", then click the pencil icon to edit the document in a fork. You can then create a pull request via the GitHub UI and include this in your proposal. You should do this in a separate branch to your draft proposal; while the proposal will be merged as soon as it goes to a vote, the amendment will only be merged if the proposal passes.

Once you are confident the proposal is in a stable state, you can proceed to phase 3.

### **Phase 3: Active Proposal — Snapshot / Governance Portal**

Use GitHub to flag your PR as Ready for Review. A contributor will:

1. Merge your PR if it meets the requirements.
2. Assign your proposal a proposal number in the form EP###.
3. Schedule the proposal for a snapshot vote.

If your proposal is a Social Proposal or a Constitutional Amendment, that's it! If the snapshot vote passes, the proposal is passed and you are done.

If your proposal is an Executable Proposal, you will now need to submit it to the governor contract for voting onchain.

To enact an Executable Proposal:

1. Ensure at least 100k ENS is delegated to your address in order to submit a proposal, or find a delegate who has enough delegated ENS to meet the proposal threshold to propose on your behalf.
2. Call the propose() function of the ENS governor (at [governor.ensdao.eth](https://etherscan.io/address/0x323a76393544d5ecca80cd6ef2a560c6a395b7e3)) to deploy your proposal.

Once the propose() function has been called, a seven day voting period is started. Ongoing discussion can take place on your proposal post. If the proposal passes successfully, a two day timelock will follow before the proposed code is executed.

## Abstract

Following the approval of [EP4.7](/dao/proposals/4.7) by the DAO, prospective service providers have submitted applications to be considered by the DAO for funding. This proposal collects successful applications for a vote by the DAO.

## Specification

EP4.7 provides for a budget of $3,600,000 USDC to be provided annually to qualifying service providers. All successful applications are summarized below in [random order](https://twitter.com/nicksdjohnson/status/1731660224031793376).

The purpose of this vote is to select service providers to receive streaming funding from the DAO. Per the [draft rules](https://github.com/alexvansande/governance-docs/blob/Streams-rules/service-provider-rules.md), selection of winning proposals uses the following process:

1. **Order Proposals**
   - Arrange all proposals in descending order based on the number of votes received.
2. **Evaluate Proposals Sequentially**
   - **Vote Threshold Check**
     - If a proposal has received fewer than 1 million votes, stop the evaluation process immediately.
   - **Comparison with 'None of the Above'**
     - If a proposal has fewer votes than the 'None of the Above' option, stop the evaluation process.
   - **Budget Check**
     - If a proposal's requested budget exceeds the remaining budget, skip it and move to the next proposal.
   - **Selection**
     - If a proposal passes the above checks, add it to the set of selected proposals. Deduct its requested budget from the remaining budget.

### Post-Selection Procedure

- If at least one service provider is chosen, the Meta-Governance working group will post an executable vote to implement the funding streams by January 10 at the latest.

## Instructions

**Vote FOR** on any service providers whom you believe that are capable of continuous evolution and enhancement of the ENS system and for which you believe offer a good cost benefit. **Do NOT vote** to any provider you do not believe to be capable of such, for which you believe the proposed projects are out of scope or for which you believe the ask is too high for the proposals. _Only vote "None of the Above" if you want to express your disapproval with the whole system and would rather **not have ANY** of the projects be selected._

## Abstract

The intent of this proposal is to add new Streams for service providers and propose a structure on how to elect them.

## Motivation

The ENS DAO constitution mandates:

_"Any income generated by the ENS treasury should primarily ensure the long-term viability of ENS and fund the ongoing development and enhancement of the ENS system. Surplus funds may be allocated to other public goods within the web3 space as determined by ENS governance."_

The Endowment has been pivotal in securing the longevity of ENS. This proposal aims to utilize new funds to establish funding streams for service providers dedicated to the continuous evolution and enhancement of the ENS system.

### **Procedure for Implementation**

Service providers interested in participating must submit their candidacy on the ENS Forum by December 1st, demonstrating their expertise and providing a plan for enhancing the ENS system. Detailed instructions will be issued following the approval of this proposal.

Candidates must stipulate their service fees in increments of US$200,000 per annum, committing to a minimum service period of 12 months. Project budgets should not exceed US$1 million annually.

A new snapshot for approval voting will be set up. Projects must obtain a minimum of 1 million ENS in approvals to proceed.

Eligible projects will be ranked by vote count. A greedy algorithm will then be applied to select the highest-voted projects, provided the cumulative budget does not exceed the preset limit.

Funding for streams will be guaranteed for a minimum of 18 months to prevent service disruptions. However, a reassessment vote will be conducted after 12 months. Although the one-year term is non-binding, and streams may be discontinued at any time by the service provider or the DAO, proper notice will be given in advance.

All outputs financed by the DAO must be released under an Open Source License permitting derivative works.

#### **Criteria for Project Qualification**

Projects may include, but are not limited to:

- Development of alternative open-source front-ends for diverse audiences or platforms.
- Maintenance of developer tools, such as SDKs, to facilitate ENS integration into various applications.
- Implementation of a referral program, complete with necessary contracts and outreach for successful execution.
- Proposals for enhancements to ENS base layer contracts for a more refined experience or to facilitate cost-effective batch transactions.

## Abstract

The ENS Meta-Governance Working Group requests funding of the below to **support operations until the September 2024 funding window**.

The Meta-Governance Working Group is responsible for providing governance oversight and supporting the management and operation of working groups through DAO tooling and governance initiatives as well as treasury management for the DAO.

This social proposal is submitted to satisfy the requirements set out in Rule 10.1.1 of the Working Group Rules ([EP 1.8](https://docs.ens.domains/v/governance/governance-proposals/term-1/ep12-working-group-rules)) and further required by [this snapshot proposal in Nov. 2023 modifying steward rules.](https://snapshot.org/#/ens.eth/proposal/0x26a5c8dec547837495707e70446d1e7cd874a91f75753c602998f6e70083a266) If this proposal is passed, the funding request will be included in a collective executable proposal put forward by all three Working Groups.

## Specification

This specification is the amount requested from the DAO treasury to the Metagov Multisig to fulfill anticipated budgetary needs through September 2024.

| Elected Stewards            | 45k            | Change to vesting contracts is planned for the 2025 guidance |

### Description of Initiatives/Pods

**Steward + Secretary Compensation**: Working Group Steward and Secretary compensation as required by [revised steard working group rules](https://snapshot.org/#/ens.eth/proposal/0x26a5c8dec547837495707e70446d1e7cd874a91f75753c602998f6e70083a266) and [totaling $294,000 USDC](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/ens-dao-steward-compensation/18063).

**Governance**: Fee reimbursements and initiatives related to reducing friction in the governance process. This can also include $ENS distributed in order to lower barriers to the governance proposal process.

**DAO Tooling**: Developing interfaces and dashboards to improve the governance process and increase transparency across the DAO. An example of DAO tooling spend is our current engagement with Agora as they help build out an enhanced DAO proposal flow to streamline the proposal process.

**Discretionary**: Funds distributed at the discretion of stewards towards new initiatives + governance experiments. In this cycle, we've consolidated the former DAO Sponsorship category into this discretionary category.

## Conclusion

This funding request will allow the ENS Meta-Governance Working Group to continue its essential work in providing governance oversight, supporting the management and operation of working groups, and ensuring effective treasury management for the DAO. The requested funds will enable us to maintain our ongoing initiatives and develop new tools to enhance the governance process. We are grateful for the community's ongoing support and engagement, which is crucial to the success of the ENS DAO. The Meta-Governance Working Group remains committed to serving the ENS community and driving the long-term growth and sustainability of the ecosystem.

### 2. Elected Steward Compensation

Provide compensation for the three elected Community Stewards @limes , @spencecoin and @coltron.eth for the entire Q1/Q2 steward term.

| Base Compensation         | $1,000/month |    5.5     |     3      |   16,500   |
| Supplemental Compensation | $2,000/month |    5.5     |     -      |   11,000   |
| **Total**                 |              | **27,500** |            |            |

**Note:** _Supplemental compensation shall be distributed to stewards and contributors involved in running operations for the WG. The supplemental compensation will be used in situations where contributors or stewards perform duties beyond what is normally expected. The steward council determines how the supplemental compensation will be split between the stewards based on the contributions of each steward._

### Considerations

Multiple parties will approve all funding disbursements using a multi-sig. This budget does not guarantee disbursement, specifically if services rendered to the DAO are incomplete or deemed unsatisfactory. If these situations arise, the working group will review them publicly at the weekly Community Steward Call.

Any funding not used will be re-allocated back to the treasury.

## Abstract

The ENS DAO has established itself as the key governance entity for the Ethereum Name Service (ENS) and has demonstrated capability and responsibility in ownership of several aspects of the protocol. We now propose the further decentralization of the ENS governance structure by transferring ownership of the ENS root key from the current multisig system (multisig.ens.eth) to the ENS DAO (wallet.ensdao.eth).

## Background

### ENS Root Key

The ENS root node is currently owned by a multisig contract. The root key can control the allocation and replacement of all TLDs except for .eth. Keyholders are well-respected individuals in the Ethereum community and, with the exception of Nick Johnson, founder of ENS, are unaffiliated with ENS. While the .eth registrar contract control has been locked and cannot be affected by the root keyholders, they still hold significant powers over the structure and functioning of the ENS Protocol.

### ENS DAO Current Powers

The ENS DAO holds ownership of the .eth registrar and has control over functionalities like the NameWrapper. The DAO does not have control over the core ENS root name, which retains the capability to create new TLDs, adjust controls for existing ones, and upgrade the contracts responsible for reverse resolution.

## Proposal

1. **Transfer of Root Key Ownership**: We propose the transfer of ownership of the ENS root key from the current multisig holders to the ENS DAO. This will consolidate governance powers and further the vision of decentralized control over the ENS Protocol.
2. **TLD Management**: While .eth is permanently set and unchangeable, the DAO will inherit the power to create and manage other top-level domains (TLD). The DAO will also have the ability to lock any TLD permanently if deemed necessary.
3. **Reverse Resolutions and L2s**: The DAO will have the capacity to update reverse resolutions. Additionally, with the Labs team's support, the DAO will explore and potentially implement primary domain names on Layer 2 solutions (L2s).

## Specification

1. Current ENS root keyholders are requested to execute a transaction transferring root key ownership to the ENS DAO's designated contract.
2. The ENS DAO commits to managing the new powers and funds in line with the [ENS DAO Constitution](/dao/constitution), ensuring transparent governance and decision-making.
3. The DAO will develop policies to govern TLD management, (oracle) pricing updates, and other key decisions.

## Coda (Conclusion)

With this proposal, we aim to further decentralize the control and governance of the ENS Protocol, placing more trust and power in the hands of the ENS community via the DAO. Community discussion will ensue on the [Governance Forum](https://discuss.ens.domains). The ballot will begin on [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/ens.eth) and, should it be passed, the current ENS root keyholders will initiate a transfer of the ENS root key to the ENS DAO where it will be managed according to the precepts outlined herein.

## Abstract

This proposal outlines the allocation of the second tranche, comprising 16,000 ETH, from the [ENS DAO](https://etherscan.io/address/0xfe89cc7abb2c4183683ab71653c4cdc9b02d44b7) to the [ENS Endowment](https://etherscan.io/address/0x4F2083f5fBede34C2714aFfb3105539775f7FE64). Additionally, it introduces minor adjustments to the existing permissions preset for maintenance purposes.

## Motivation

In March 2023, the ENS Endowment was formally established following the [joint proposal](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/updated-endaoment-proposal-karpatkey-steakhouse-financial/14799) by karpatkey and @steakhouse, after the successful execution of [E.P 3.4 - Fund the Endowment (first tranche)](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/ens/proposal/90786656233306599444783442367171420493182391933134906270328139870999449830964). The community had expressed a preference for a phased funding approach, leading to the decision to allocate the funds in two equal tranches over a six-month interval. As we reach this pivotal milestone, this proposal seeks community approval for the second tranche.

### Endowment Update

Based on the most recent monthly report detailing the Endowment's performance for August 2023, the Endowment has achieved:

- $28.03 M of ncAUM (non-custodial assets under management)
- 100% of capital utilisation
- An APY (annual percentage yield) of 4.1%
- Monthly farming results of $93,841

A comprehensive review [post](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/karpatkey-h1-2023-review-for-the-ens-endowment/17682) detailing our collaborative efforts with the ENS DAO has been recently shared on the forum. We encourage community members to consult this post for insights into our achievements and ongoing initiatives.

#### Cumulative Revenues

In the 182 days since the Endowment was established, 173 ETH have been accrued through ETH-neutral strategies and $136,764 in stablecoin revenues via USD-neutral strategies. Operational reports were initially shared on a [weekly basis](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/endowment-weekly-reports/16665) and later transitioned to [monthly updates](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/endowment-monthly-reports/17614), all of which were made available on the forum for community review.

The Endowment's phased initiation should also be taken into account when interpreting these results. Full capital utilisation was only achieved 49 days after the Endowment's inception, following the completion of the earned ETH-to-stablecoin tranche swaps. This staggered approach had a discernible impact on the reported financial metrics.

Taking into consideration the revenue generated during the most recent four months—after reaching 100% capital utilisation—the projected annual revenues at the current Endowment's size stand at 367 ETH from ETH-neutral strategies and an equivalent of $351,654 in stablecoins from USD-neutral strategies. This results in a projected Annual Percentage Rate (APR) of approximately 3.4%.

## Specification

### Fund Transfer

Transfer 16,000 ETH to the Endowment (0x4F2083f5fBede34C2714aFfb3105539775f7FE64).

### Permissions preset adjustments

In line with our commitment to streamline governance and reduce the frequency of voting events for the community, we propose targeted adjustments to the existing permissions preset within this proposal. Specifically, we are requesting three key changes:

- **Whitelisting the updated wstETH-WETH Pool and Gauge**: As part of our ongoing optimization, we propose to whitelist the updated wstETH-WETH pool on [Balancer](https://app.balancer.fi/#/ethereum/pool/0x93d199263632a4ef4bb438f1feb99e57b4b5f0bd0000000000000000000005c2) and its corresponding gauge on [Aura](https://app.aura.finance/#/1/pool/153).
- **Revoking Permissions for Aura's bb-a-usd Pool**: In light of the recent [vulnerability](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/vulnerability-found-in-some-pools/5102) disclosed by Balancer on August 24, 2023, we recommend revoking all permissions associated with potentially compromised pools. It's important to note that the Endowment had no exposure to these compromised pools at the time the vulnerability was made public.
- **Whitelisting the **_**delegatecall**_** function on Cow Swap**: A minor bug was found in the existing preset configuration. Specifically, the _signOrder_ function within Cow Swap's order signer contract is designed to be executed solely via a delegate call, a capability not currently supported by the preset. This oversight not only hindered functionality but also revealed a flaw in the SDK preset testing framework. The issue has been swiftly addressed and rectified in a recent [commit](https://github.com/gnosis/zodiac-modifier-roles-v1/commit/c22b1fa8c10b1e3cfb2c1fceef24498c25f3ea2d) to the codebase.

As is customary, we are presenting an updated version of the ["Preset permissions - ENS Endowment'' document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vhws_fnbIws8EUItK14V2TVIecHdJLxKzN8Za4d5L0M/edit). This document comprehensively lists all permissions granted to karpatkey, with newly requested permissions highlighted in green and any revocations marked in red.

We are also sharing the [payload](https://gist.github.com/santinomics/bb6b345ff977e7451ff0506e253ebc4c/044f46247ab57f8c65bf608b83eacefa128671f7) to apply the proposed changes for your review. We strongly encourage community members with the required technical expertise to scrutinise the content and share their invaluable feedback.

## Transactions

All transactions can be found in the following [payload](https://gist.github.com/santinomics/bb6b345ff977e7451ff0506e253ebc4c/044f46247ab57f8c65bf608b83eacefa128671f7).

_Note: This was previously numbered EP4._

## Summary

Create four foundational working groups and establish rules related to the creation, management, and dissolution of working groups within the ENS DAO.

## Abstract

The work-related activities of the ENS DAO will take place within working groups. Each working group will have a specific focus area and mission, aligned with the constitution and needs of the DAO.

This proposal establishes four foundational working groups:

1. Meta-Governance: providing governance oversight and support of the management and operation of the ENS DAO and working groups;
2. ENS Ecosystem: continuing development and improvement of the ENS protocol and ecosystem, with a focus on all technical matters related to ENS;
3. Community: supporting the people and organizations that are users of ENS, with a focus on non-technical matters; and
4. Public Goods: amplifying ENS as a public good and funding public goods within the ENS ecosystem, and more broadly within web3.

This proposal also sets out rules related to the creation and dissolution of working groups and outlines how working groups will be managed within the DAO.

## Motivation

Establishing working groups to manage DAO-related work will allow decisions to be made, and action to be taken, without the need for every initiative or decision of the DAO to be passed as a proposal.

The creation of working groups will streamline the management of the DAO into core areas that will persist, irrespective of changes in activities or contributors. A working group system will promote stability and encourage long-term thinking and planning.

The working group structure will provide new and existing community members clear onboarding pathways for meaningful participation and engagement in the DAO.

## Specification

Create four foundational working groups and establish rules related to the creation, management, and dissolution of working groups within the ENS DAO (‘**DAO**’).

1. **Working Groups**
   1. Four foundational working groups will be established within the DAO:
      1. Meta-Governance Working Group;
      2. ENS Ecosystem Working Group;
      3. Community Working Group; and
      4. Public Goods Working Group.
2. **Formation of Working Groups**
   1. To create a new working group, a social proposal, as defined by the [ENS governance documentation](https://docs.ens.domains/v/governance/process#types-of-proposal) (‘**Social Proposal**’), must be put forward and passed by the DAO.
   2. A Social Proposal to create a new working group must demonstrate that the new working group is needed and the work cannot be undertaken within an existing working group.
3. **Dissolution of Working Groups**
   1. A working group can be dissolved by passing a Social Proposal requesting the dissolution of a working group or working groups.
   2. If an active proposal is put forward to dissolve a working group, all working group funds, including outgoing payments, within that working group, are to be frozen with immediate effect, pending the outcome of the vote.
   3. Upon the dissolution of a working group, any and all unspent working group funds from that working group, at the time of dissolution, must be immediately returned to the DAO treasury, without delay.
4. **Working Group Stewards**
   1. Each working group shall be managed by five stewards (hereafter a '**Steward**' or '**Stewards**').
   2. Stewards will be elected, unless otherwise stated in these rules, to serve within working groups for a set period of time (hereafter known as a '**Term**' or '**Terms**').
   3. There are two Terms each calendar year:
      1. The first Term commences at 9am UTC on January 1 each year and ends immediately prior to the commencement of the second Term ('**First Term**'); and
      2. The second Term commences at 9am UTC on July 1 each year and ends immediately prior to the commencement of the First Term of the following year ('**Second Term**').
   4. Stewards are responsible for managing the operations of each working group.
   5. The responsibilities of Stewards include, but are not limited to:
      1. Managing operational tasks related to the administration of a working group;
      2. Maintaining a description that sets forth the focus and intent of the working group;
      3. Developing working group goals for the Term and providing a clear road map for achieving those goals, to be published in the ENS governance forum within the first 30 days of a Term;
      4. Approving the creation and dissolution of sub-groups or workstreams within a working group to undertake work and/or carry out specific projects or tasks;
      5. Requesting working group funds from the DAO; and
      6. Approving and making funding available to sub-groups, workstreams, or contributors within a working group.
   6. To request working group funds, Stewards of all working groups will collaborate to submit an active executable proposal, as defined by the [ENS governance documentation](https://docs.ens.domains/v/governance/process#types-of-proposal) ('**Collective Proposal**'), to the DAO within the final 15 days (inclusive) of the months of January, March, July, and October each calendar year (each a '**Funding Window**').
      1. In order for a working group to have a funding request included in a Collective Proposal submitted to the DAO during a Funding Window, the funding request must have passed as a Social Proposal in the same Funding Window.
      2. In the case of an emergency, where working group funds are needed by a working group outside of a Funding Window, an Executable Proposal may be submitted at any time by a Steward of a working group to request funds from the DAO.
5. **Steward Eligibility and Nominations**
   1. Any individual is eligible to nominate themselves to be a Steward of a working group within the DAO ('**Eligible Person**' or '**Eligible Persons**').
   2. To be eligible to be included in the ballot for First Term elections of a given year, Eligible Persons must nominate themselves between 9am UTC on December 6 and 9am UTC on December 9 ('**First Term Nomination Window**').
   3. To be eligible to be included in the ballot for Second Term elections of a given year, Eligible Persons must nominate themselves between 9am UTC on June 6 and 9am UTC on June 9 ('**Second Term Nomination Window**').
   4. An Eligible Person may nominate themselves to become a Steward of a working group or working groups during the First Term Nomination Window or the Second Term Nomination Window (each a '**Nomination Window**'), by meeting the requirements set out in a call for nominations posted in the relevant working group category of the ENS governance forum.
   5. An Eligible Person who completes the steps outlined in rule 5.4 above during a Nomination Window and receives 10,000 signed votes to support their nomination will be included in the ballot as a nominee in the election for Stewards that takes place following that Nomination Window ('**Nominee**').
6. **Steward Elections**
   1. Elections for working group Stewards for the First Term of a given year will take place by a ranked-choice vote of governance token holders using signed messages and will be open for 120 hours, commencing at 9am UTC on December 10 each year ('**First Term Election Window**').
   2. Elections for working group Stewards for the Second Term of a given year will take place by a ranked-choice vote of governance token holders using signed messages and will be open for 120 hours, commencing at 9am UTC on June 10 each year (**'Second Term Election Window**').
   3. The top-ranked Nominees from each working group vote held during a First Term Election Window or a Second Term Election Window (each an '**Election Window**'), will fill any available positions for the role of Steward for those working groups for the Term immediately following an Election Window, based on the order in which they are ranked in each working group vote.
   4. A Nominee elected to serve as a Steward may not take up the role of Steward for more than two working groups during a single Term.
7. **Delay of Nominations or Elections**
   1. In the event that nominations or elections for Stewards take place after a Nomination Window or after an Election Window, the nomination process or elections shall take place, as otherwise prescribed in rules 5 and 6 above, as soon as is practicable after the missed Nomination Window or missed Election Window.
   2. In the event that an election takes place outside of an Election Window and after the commencement date of a new Term, outgoing Stewards from the previous Term shall stay in their positions as working group Stewards until immediately prior to 9am UTC the day following the end of the election, which, for the avoidance of doubt, is 120 hours after voting in those elections commenced.
   3. In the event that an election takes place outside of an Election Window and after the commencement date of a new Term, newly elected Stewards will assume the responsibilities of stewardship within working groups at 9am UTC the day following the end of the election, as defined in rule 7.2 above, for the remainder of that Term.
8. **Core Team Stewards**
   1. For the First Term, commencing January 1 2022 at 9am UTC, each working group will include two Stewards who are core team members of True Names Limited (Singapore) ('**TNL**'), as selected by TNL and not subject to the Steward nomination and election process outlined in rules 5 and 6 above.
   2. For the Second Term, commencing July 1 2022 at 9am UTC, each working group will include one Steward who is a core team member of TNL, as selected by TNL and not subject to the Steward nomination and election process outlined in rules 5 and 6 above.
   3. For the First Term of the following year, commencing January 1 2023, and for all Terms thereafter, all Stewards must be elected and appointed in accordance with the rules set out in rules 5 and 6 above.
9. **Removal and Replacement of Stewards**
   1. Stewards may be removed at any time by:
      1. a Social Proposal passed by the DAO; or
      2. a simple indicative majority vote among the Stewards of a given working group, with the outcome of the vote communicated in the relevant working group category of the ENS governance forum.
   2. Stewards may step down from their position at any time by communicating their intention to step down in the ENS governance forum.
   3. In the event that a Steward is removed, steps down, or is unable to continue as a Steward, for whatever reason, prior to the end of a Term, any vacant positions will be filled for the remainder of a Term by the next highest ranked Nominee(s) in a given working group from the most recent working group vote in the most recent election for Stewards.
   4. In the event that a Steward steps down or is removed prior to the end of a Term and is a member of the core team of TNL in accordance with rule 8.1 or 8.2 above, the vacant position(s) will be filled by a core team member or team members of TNL, as selected by TNL.
   5. Any Steward selected by TNL in accordance with rule 8.1 or 8.2 above, can be removed by TNL at any time prior to the end of a Term, for any reason, and replaced by another core team member for the remainder of that Term.
10. **Compensation for Stewards**
    1. Elected Stewards are eligible to receive fair compensation for their work as a Steward.
    2. All requests for Steward compensation must be detailed in a Collective Proposal for working group funds submitted to the DAO in accordance with rule 4.6.
    3. Stewards may not receive compensation for their role as a Steward outside of that compensation expressly provided for in a Collective Proposal submitted to the DAO in accordance with rule 10.2.
    4. Stewards selected by TNL are not eligible to receive compensation from the DAO or working groups for their work as a Steward.
11. **Amendments**
    1. These rules may be amended at any time by passing a Social Proposal.

## Next Steps

This proposal will be open for voting on Snapshot for five days. This vote will be a single choice vote. You may vote 'for' or 'against' the proposal, or choose to abstain from the vote.

By voting 'for' this proposal, you are voting in favor of creating four foundational working groups and establishing rules related to the creation, management, and dissolution of working groups within the ENS DAO, as provided in this proposal.

Given the time of year, Steward nominations and elections for the First Term of 2022 will be delayed until the beginning of 2022.

The Nomination Window for the First Term of 2022 will be open between 9am UTC on January 5, 2022 and 9am UTC on January 8, 2022. Any individual is eligible to nominate themselves to be a Steward of a working group or working groups during this Nomination Window. All Eligible Persons who satisfy the requirements set out in rule 5.4 and 5.5 will be included on the ballot for the First Term elections. More details about the nomination process will be available in the call for nominations released prior to the Nomination Window opening.

The Election Window for the First Term of 2022 will be open for 120 hours, commencing at 9am UTC on January 10 2022. Following the election, in accordance with rule 7.3, newly elected Stewards will assume the responsibilities of stewardship within working groups at 9am UTC on January 16, 2022, for the remainder of the First Term.

## Abstract

The intent of this proposal is to modify the working group guidelines to enhance the DAO's ability to attract and retain talent.

## Motivation

By increasing the term length, we aim to enable potential stewards to allocate more time to the DAO and to establish a transparent and predictable compensation structure for the delegates and token community.

### Proposed changes

#### Regarding term changes

These amendments are designed to extend the stewardship term, allowing candidates to commit more substantially to the DAO and benefit from a more stable financial prospect.

There are numerous small textual changes that change the two terms into a single one.

**Current:**

> 3.2. Stewards will be elected to serve within working groups for a set period of time (hereafter known as a 'Term' or 'Terms').
>
> 3.3. There are two Terms each calendar year:
>
> 1. The first Term commences at 9am UTC on January 1 each year and ends immediately prior to the commencement of the second Term ('First Term'); and
> 2. The second Term commences at 9am UTC on July 1 each year and ends immediately prior to the commencement of the First Term of the following year ('Second Term').

**Proposed:**

> 3.2. Stewards will be elected to serve within working groups for a set period of one calendar year (hereafter known as a 'Term').
>
> 3.3. The Term for Stewards commences at 9am UTC on January 1 each year and ends immediately prior to the commencement of the Term of the following year.

Some minor changes also occur in sections 4 and 5 just to the same effect. [See the full diff below](https://github.com/ensdomains/governance-docs/pull/44/files).

#### Regarding changes to fair compensation guidelines

The aim here is to bolster the transparency surrounding compensation practices, benefiting voters and delegates and enhancing the DAO's capacity to attract and maintain skilled contributors. These are proposed amendments to section 11 (compensation for stewards)

**Proposed Addition:**

> 10.4. The Meta-Governance working group are responsible for defining standards for fair compensation ('Compensation Guidelines').
>
> 10.5. The Compensation Guidelines shall be defined prior to the Nomination Window for each term and can only take effect for the following term. Summary

The proposed changes intend to make Steward compensation more predictable and transparent, which serves the dual purpose of attracting more talent to the space as well as being fully transparent towards the electors.

## Voting

The vote is an approval voting meaning you need to vote to approve or reject each individual change. Changes will only take effect if the vote for approval on each section is higher than the rejection

This EP will initiate the Streams for Service Providers as selected on [EP4.9](https://docs.ens.domains/dao/proposals/4.9)

## Abstract

[EP 4.7](https://docs.ens.domains/dao/proposals/4.7) proposed the concept of Streams for service providers and set its budget at $3.6M per annum. EP4.9 selected the following Service providers and their annual budget:

| Service Provider Name    | Annual Stream |
| ------------------------ | ------------- |
| ETH.LIMO                 | $500,000.00   |
| NameHash Labs            | $600,000.00   |
| Resolverworks.eth        | $700,000.00   |
| Blockful                 | $300,000.00   |
| Unruggable               | $400,000.00   |
| Wildcard Labs            | $200,000.00   |
| Ethereum Follow Protocol | $500,000.00   |
| Namespace                | $200,000.00   |
| UNICORN.ETH              | $200,000.00   |

The Metagov Working Group has decided this will be implemented in the following manner:

1. Superfluid has been selected as the stream platform (details of which can be found on [this RFP](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/rfp-stream-platform-for-ens-service-providers/18448))
2. A new wallet, the "[Stream Management Pod](https://app.safe.global/settings/setup?safe=eth:0xB162Bf7A7fD64eF32b787719335d06B2780e31D1)" has been created as a Global.Safe (Gnosis Safe) wallet. It requires 3 out of 5 signatures to execute any transaction. Its members are the 3 Metagov Stewards, the secretary and the DAO Governor contract.
3. **This EP includes 5 Executable Transactions**, as follows:
   1. **APPROVE** Superfluid contracts to wrap one month worth of USDC streaming (300,000 USDC);
   2. **WRAP** one month worth of USDC streaming (300,000 USDC to USDCx);
   3. **START A STREAM** to the Stream Management Pod of 0.114155251141552512 USDC per second [1];
   4. **APPROVE** AutoWrap [2] contract to wrap an additional 5.1M USDC (this, added to the already wrapped 300k, should be enough to cover 18 months of the stream, after that a new EP will be required to keep the stream running);
   5. **ENABLE AUTO-WRAP** to keep wrapping USDC to USDCx on a monthly basis (lower limit 200,000, upper limit 500,000).
4. Meanwhile the Stewards are reaching out to all representatives of the stream providers. Alex Urbelis, the general Counsel for ENS Labs, has drafted a service provider agreement and is acquiring the services of Urbelis to run a basic KYC and Sanctions protection. All Service Providers will be required to go through this process before receiving their first stream.
5. On February 1st Stream Management Pod will start creating individual streams to the Organizations who have completed the steps outlined in bullet #4. Because of Superfluid unique no-upfront-capital-lockup streams, it means that when all of 9 Service Providers Streams start, the Stream Management Pod will be forwarding 100% of the money it receives directly into the Service Providers. [3]

### Notes

[1]: USDC has a precision of 6 decimal places, but SuperUSDC has a precision of 18 decimals. The value of 0.114155251141552512 per second corresponds to approximately 9863.01 USDC per day and in 3,600,000.000000000018432 USDC per year in a non-leap year. In leap years (such as the current one) it will mean an extra $9.8K is paid in the 29th of February.

[2]: [Autowrapper](https://etherscan.io/address/0x1D65c6d3AD39d454Ea8F682c49aE7744706eA96d#code) is a [series](https://etherscan.io/address/0x30aE282CF477E2eF28B14d0125aCEAd57Fe1d7a1#code) of [contracts](https://etherscan.io/address/0x1D65c6d3AD39d454Ea8F682c49aE7744706eA96d#code) developed by superfluid. When pinged (and anyone would be able to ping it), if the amount of tokens that the DAO has wrapped is below the lower limit, it will automatically wrap new tokens in order to keep the stream running. The goal is to reduce smart contract risk. If Superfluid is somehow hacked, ENS will not lose more than the upper limit set here (about 50 days worth of funds). If both Superfluid AND the autowrapper are hacked at the same time, ENS cannot lose more than the maximum USDC allowance (18 months worth of funds).

[3]: Any capital that remains in the pod (due to the difference between the day this EP is executed and the day the last Service Provider stream is active) will be still considered under the DAO's ownership and will be used only as a buffer (if autowrapper fails, we will have some weeks to resolve it without interrupting payments) and to solve any logistical issues with service providers. It will NOT count towards Metagov's budget nor it will it be used to any other purpose than the service provider management.

## Specification

We will now details the transactions to be executed on this EP:

All contracts have verifiable code. You can use tools such as the [Calldata decoder](https://tools.deth.net/calldata-decoder) to verify the correctness of the calldata and etherscan to look deeper into them. You can also _simulate the transactions yourself_ using [this repo](https://github.com/d10r/ens-streams).

The terms for the createWrapSchedule are the address of the superToken (super-usdc), the address of the Strategy contract, the address of the base token (USDC), the expiry (set to the far future), lowerLimit and upperLimit. These last two are set in seconds and mean that if, when the autowrapper is pinged, the stream has less than 21 days in it's runway, then it will automatically wrap 50 days worth of funds.

## Abstract

We have identified that the legacy ENS multisig, which originally controlled ENS before the DAO was created, still has the 'controller' role on the ENS root. This means that a majority of multisig keyholders could create or replace any ENS TLD other than .eth. .eth is locked and cannot be modified by the DAO or anyone else.

In order to correct this oversight, this proposal revokes the legacy multisig's controller role from the root contract.

## Specification

Call `setController` on the ENS `Root` contract at `0xaB528d626EC275E3faD363fF1393A41F581c5897`, passing in the address of the legacy multisig, `0xCF60916b6CB4753f58533808fA610FcbD4098Ec0`.

## Summary

This proposal aims to compensate the blockful team for their work in identifying, analyzing, reporting and mitigating a severe vulnerability in ENS DAO's governance structure.

## Background

In March 2024, blockful uncovered a critical vulnerability that could have led to a [~$150M](https://dune.com/steakhouse/ens-steakhouse) theft and protocol capture. Their subsequent work led to the implementation of the Security Council, significantly enhancing ENS DAO's resilience against attacks.

## Contribution Details

The team involved is a [different](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/blockful-service-provider-reports/19553#p-54163-other-contributions-not-related-to-service-provider-scope-14) squad than the one working on the scope of the [ENS service provider](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/blockful-service-provider-reports/19553). It was developed by 2 researchers, 1 smart contract engineer and 4 different auditors the team has worked with previously. Summing up to ~600 hours, the scope includes:

- Comprehensive vulnerability assessment and risk analysis: **[Here](https://mirror.xyz/research.blockful.eth/-PfMduhpxdypPrutofr6099T4ROpsAmX0fPNbvDgR_k)** is our detailed security report.
- Data analysis of ENS governance metrics and study of past DAO attacker's behaviors.
- Design, development and deployment of the Security Council contract and multisig.
- The Security Council was thought with several key features to balance security and decentralization.
- Smart contract implementation and testing ([GitHub](https://github.com/blockful-io/security-council-ens))
- Governance proposal drafting and support [[1](https://snapshot.org/#/ens.eth/proposal/0xf3a4673fe04a3ecfed4a2f066f6ced1539a5466d61630428333360b843653c54), [2](https://snapshot.org/#/ens.eth/proposal/0xa0b1bfadf6853b5b0d59d3c4d73c434fc6389339887d05de805361372eb17c3a), [3](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/ens/proposal/42329103797433777309488042029679811802172320979541414683300183273376839219133)]

More details can be found on the links above for past proposals and the [report](https://mirror.xyz/research.blockful.eth/-PfMduhpxdypPrutofr6099T4ROpsAmX0fPNbvDgR_k).

## Compensation Rationale

As a team that is totally bootstrapped and never received any investment, this support us to keep it sustainable with the resources invested towards this initiative. The requested amount represents fair compensation for:

- The potential loss prevention of ~$150M, capture of the DAO and protocol. The attack is anything but theoretical and there are actually many groups of investors who specialize in "risk free value raiders". They have exerted the attack on other DAOs before. Currently there are [unknown whales](https://etherscan.io/address/0x245445940b317e509002eb682e03f4429184059d#tokentxns) buying ENS for +450 days and have ~2M ENS, showing how feasible the scenario is, more than the average quorum, in one wallet.
- A critical code bug bounty in [ENS is $250k USDC](https://immunefi.com/bug-bounty/ens/scope/#assets). Our work was much beyond identifying and disclosing.
- Significantly lower cost compared to standard rates charged by other security service providers in the DAO space, which typically demand liquid compensation. An example is that Open Zeppelin (one of the most reputable players in security) [charges $4M/year at Compound](https://compound.finance/governance/proposals/76), which recently [suffered](https://mirror.xyz/research.blockful.eth/v0GEP49oXP1gzMDlyP91-S4XIa8PIOd0vKq-6R8f54I) this type of attack.
- Months of dedicated work by the team involved (researchers, devs and auditors).
- The long-term value added to ENS through enhanced security.
- Our commitment to ENS's long-term success and continued contribution, as evidenced by the 2-year vesting schedule.

## Compensation Structure

- Total amount: 100k USDC + 15k vested ENS tokens
- Vesting period: 2 years
- Vesting start date: April 8, 2024 (date of initial research disclosure)
- Vesting schedule: Linear vesting

## Benefits to ENS DAO

- Sets a positive precedent that **responsible vulnerability disclosure and correction are rewarded**, encouraging future security contributions
- Preserves DAO treasury liquidity by using part of the bounty in ENS tokens instead of USDC or ETH
- Enhances governance security by increasing the number of engaged, security-focused token holders

## Conclusion

By approving this compensation, ENS DAO acknowledges the critical importance of security research and proactive governance improvements. The vesting structure ensures ongoing commitment and aligns incentives for continued contribution to ENS's security and stability.

## Success Criteria

For this social proposal to pass, the following quorum and voting requirements must be met:

Quorum: The proposal must receive a minimum of 1% of the total supply of $ENS (1 million votes) in the form of "For" and "Abstain" votes combined. "Against" votes do not count towards quorum.

Approval: Once the quorum is reached, the proposal requires a simple majority (>50%) of "For" votes among the "For" and "Against" votes to pass. "Abstain" votes do not count towards the approval calculation.

## Description

### Summary

This proposal aims to reimburse eth.limo for ongoing legal fees related to the operation of the eth.limo/eth.link gateway services.

### Background

#### The Human Costs of Public Goods

At eth.limo we continuously strive to deliver a high quality ENS gateway experience. We understand the critical utility that our service provides and we have dedicated countless hours to developing and maintaining the gateway infrastructure that powers thousands of dApps and dWebsites alike.

Speaking beyond purely technical requirements, one aspect of operating eth.limo that is often overlooked is the human cost. We are a small team with limited resources who are dedicated 24/7 to ensure that we respond to support requests in a timely fashion, work with other cutting edge ecosystem projects for integrations, and provide on-call availability for any server-side issues that might arise. In addition, we are constantly handling abuse complaints and other matters that often go unmentioned.

We believe in public goods and the utility they provide, which is why we have sacrificed time with friends and family in order to fulfil our obligations to the ENS and broader Web3 communities by constantly working to ensure a stable and available user experience.

#### The Legal Costs of Public Goods

Operating public infrastructure comes with a unique set of challenges, many of which we were not expecting, such as enforcement and dispute-related legal fees. Being on the frontlines of bridging Web2 → Web3 means that we are often the first point of contact for law enforcement, abuse complaints, and legal and regulatory requests. As one can imagine, this quickly begins to take a toll on our financial resources and mental health.

At present, eth.limo has been labouring under US federal requests, as a third-party, that has dragged on for months and will likely continue to do so well into 2025. We are currently unable to provide further details regarding the nature of this matter, but rest assured, as soon as we are permitted to, we will provide a more fulsome summary to the Web3 community.

As a US company, we are legally required to cooperate with the US Federal Government in response to certain types of lawful requests. Such required compliance has proven to be an extreme financial burden in the form of fees and expenses from our lawyers and emotional distress not just on us individually, but to our families as well.

We negotiated significant discounts from our counsel, who are well-versed in Web3, and who recognize the importance of eth.limo and the significant public good service it provides. At present, we have no way to anticipate expected future legal costs associated with this specific set of legal requests, nor are we able to forecast any additional legal matters or proceedings that may arise as a result of maintaining eth.limo as a public good.

This has the indirect effect of limiting our ability to grow and scale the eth.limo service, as well as to pursue future plans relating to additional integrations and roadmap efforts. To put this into perspective, we have already spent close to $250k USD in legal fees over the past few months. Without additional funding, this very likely could consume our remaining financial resources, leaving us without the ability to continue to operate eth.limo as a public good.

# Moderator Checklists [Process documentation and checklists for DAO moderators handling proposals]

## Advancing a proposal to a vote

When the author of a Draft Proposal asks for it to be advanced to a vote, and you agree, follow the below steps:

- [ ] Modify the title to include the next sequential EP number (eg `[EP4] ...`).
- [ ] Move from Draft Proposals to Active Proposals category.
- [ ] Delete Discourse poll (if any).
- [ ] [Create a Snapshot vote](https://snapshot.org/#/ens.eth/create):
  - [ ] 5 day duration.
  - [ ] Simple voting unless otherwise called for in the proposal.
  - [ ] Copy and paste the title and contents of the proposal to the vote.
  - [ ] Add a link to the forum thread at the bottom.
- [ ] Replicate the proposal in the governance docs:
  - [ ] Create the header table with a link to the forum thread and snapshot vote.
  - [ ] Copy and paste the title and contents of the proposal.
  - [ ] Set the status to 'Active'.
  - [ ] Submit as a PR for the docs.
- [ ] Edit the forum thread to link to the Snapshot vote at the top.
- [ ] Send a forum DM to the 'delegates' group announcing that the proposal is up for voting.
- [ ] Send a tweet announcing that the proposal is up for voting.

## Proposal pass/rejection

When a proposal's voting period concludes, follow the below steps:

- [ ] Update the proposal in the governance docs:
  - For an Executable Proposal that just passed its Snapshot vote, set the status to 'Awaiting Execution'.
  - Otherwise, set the status to 'Passed' if it passed and 'Rejected' if it did not.
- [ ] Update the forum thread:
  - [ ] Remove the Snapshot/Tally link at the top.
  - [ ] List the current status (as above) at the top of the proposal.
  - [ ] If the proposal is Passed or Rejected, lock the thread.
- [ ] If the proposal is an Executable Proposal and passed its snapshot vote:
  - Do the "Executing a proposal" checklist below if it is ready to be executed.
  - Otherwise, add a note to the forum thread about when it will be scheduled for execution.
- [ ] If the proposal is a Constitutional Amendment:
  - Merge the PR to the constitution if it passed.
  - Close the PR otherwise.
- [ ] If the proposal requires any other action, alert those responsible of the need to enact it.
- [ ] Send a tweet announcing the result of the proposal.

## Executing a proposal

When an Executable Proposal is ready to be executed, follow the below steps. If you do not have sufficient voting power to submit an executable proposal, ask someone else to do this for you.

- [ ] Construct the executable proposal on the interface of your choice, such as [Tally](https://www.withtally.com/governance/ens/proposal/new) or [OZ Defender](https://defender.openzeppelin.com/#/admin/contracts/mainnet-0x323A76393544d5ecca80cd6ef2A560C6a395b7E3/newAdminAction?), following the instructions in the proposal.
- [ ] Have someone else double-check the proposal is structured correctly for you.
- [ ] Optionally, use [Tenderly](https://dashboard.tenderly.co) to simulate the effects of submitting the proposal directly to the timelock contract to check it has the expected effect.
- [ ] Submit the proposal to the chain.
- [ ] Add a link to the vote on Tally to the top of the proposal on the forum thread.
- [ ] Update the status of the proposal in the governance docs to 'Active'.
- [ ] Send a forum DM to the 'delegates' group announcing the proposal is up for execution, with a link to the Tally proposal page.
- [ ] Send a tweet announcing that the proposal is up for voting.

# Governance Process [An overview of the ENS DAO's governance processes, and how you can get involved]

This document is a suggested process for developing and advancing ENS Governance Proposals. It is a living document intended to be owned, modified and enforced by the ENS community.

## Venues

[discuss.ens.domains](https://discuss.ens.domains) is a Discourse forum for governance-related discussion. Community members must register for an account before sharing or liking posts. Registering for the forum allows community members to post in the general forum; for access to the working groups, fill out the [participant request form](https://airtable.com/shrv2xP39SmuCcd5j).

There are three workstream categories: [Meta-Governance](https://discuss.ens.domains/c/meta-governance/28), [Public Goods](https://discuss.ens.domains/c/public-goods/37), and [ENS Ecosystem](https://discuss.ens.domains/c/ens-ecosystem/32). Each category has subcategories for each of the steps of the governance process described below.

### Snapshot

[Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/ens.eth/) is a simple voting interface that allows users to signal sentiment off-chain. Votes on snapshot are weighted by the number of ENS delegated to the address used to vote.

### Governance portals

[Tally](https://tally.ensdao.org) and [Agora](https://agora.ensdao.org) are governance portal that allows token holders to delegate their votes, and allows delegates to create and vote on binding proposals.

## Getting Work Done

You are probably here because you want the DAO to _do_ something. The primary mechanism by which the DAO gets things done is via "Requests for Proposal" (RFPs). An RFP is a request from the DAO for contributors to offer to do work on its behalf, and receive compensation in return.

Anyone who identifies a need can write an RFP, and if the RFP is passed, anyone can write a proposal in response and be awarded the work. Even if you believe you can do the work yourself, you will still need to pass an RFP in order to be awarded the work (and corresponding compensation) by the DAO.

RFPs vary in detail and complexity. An RFP for improving the DAO's documentation may only be a paragraph or two long, and proposals for it will be equally short. At the other extreme, an RFP for managing the DAO's funds may be lengthy, and a successful proposal could be multiple pages justifying the proposer's ability to take on the job.

### The RFP Process

RFPs all follow this process:

1.  Write a draft RFP ([template here](https://github.com/ensdomains/docs/blob/master/src/public/governance/rfp-template.md)) and post it as a discussion thread in the appropriate working group on [the DAO forum](https://discuss.ens.domains/). At a minimum, RFPs must:

    a. Explain the need for the RFP and describe the work to be done - the scope of work and deliverables.

    b. Specify the requirements for a winning bid - criteria for selection.

    c. Provide a timeline for submissions and completion of the work.

    d. Nominate a party who will select a winning bid and approve & disburse compensation (the RFP manager). Normally this will be the working group who adopts the RFP.

    e. Specify a maximum budget for the RFP.

2.  Incorporate feedback from DAO participants into your draft. When you believe it is ready, tag the stewards of the working group and request they consider adopting it.
3.  If the stewards agree to adopt your RFP, they will decide if it can be paid out of WG funds, or if it needs a DAO wide vote.

    a. If the RFP can be paid out of WG funds, they will set a submission period and post it as an active RFP.

    b. Otherwise, the stewards will create an executable proposal (or, they may ask you to do this) asking the DAO as a whole to approve the RFP. The proposal should contain the RFP. The executable component should specify approvals from the DAO funds to the RFP manager in the amount of the maximum budget for the proposal.

4.  Once the RFP is approved - either by the WG or by a DAO-wide vote - the submission period begins. You or a WG steward should create a post on the DAO forum for proposals, and anyone can submit a proposal to this thread.
5.  Once the submission period is concluded, the RFP manager selects a winning bid. Normally the manager will be the stewards of the working group who has adopted your RFP.
6.  The author of the winning proposal commences the work. As they meet milestones specified in the RFP and their proposal, they can request compensation from the RFP manager, who disburses it from the allocated funds.

## Passing a Proposal

### Types of Proposal

There are three main types of governance proposals you can make:

1. **[Executable Proposal](https://github.com/ensdomains/docs/tree/master/src/public/governance/executable-proposal-template.md):** This is a proposal for a series of smart contract operations to be executed by accounts the DAO controls. These can include transfers of tokens as well as arbitrary smart contract calls. Examples of this include allocating funding to a workstream multisig wallet, or upgrading an ENS core contract. Executable proposals have a quorum requirement of 1% and require a minimum approval of 50% to pass.
2. **[Social Proposal](https://github.com/ensdomains/docs/tree/master/src/public/governance/social-proposal-template.md)**: This is a proposal that asks for the agreement of the DAO on something that cannot be enforced onchain. Examples of this include a proposal to change the royalty percentage for the ENS secondary market on OpenSea, or a petition to the root keyholders. Social proposals have a quorum requirement of 1% and require a minimum approval of 50% to pass.
3. **[Constitutional Amendment](https://github.com/ensdomains/docs/tree/master/src/public/governance/constitutional-amendment-template.md)**: This is a social proposal that asks the DAO to amend the constitution. Your draft proposal should include a [diff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diff) showing the exact changes you propose to make to the constitution. Rules for amending the constitution are set in the constitution itself, and currently require a quorum of 1% and a minimum approval of two thirds to pass.

### **Phase 1: Temperature Check — Discourse**

The purpose of the Temperature Check is to determine if there is sufficient will to make changes to the status quo.

To create a Temperature Check, ask a general, non-biased question to the community on [discuss.ens.domains](https://discuss.ens.domains) about a potential change (example: “Should ENS decrease registration costs for 3-letter domains?”). Forum posts should be in the "DAO-wide -> Temperature Check" category.

Temperature checks are informal and optional; it's up to you to use the feedback to decide if you want to proceed further with your proposal.

### **Phase 2: Draft Proposal — GitHub**

The purpose of the Draft Proposal is to establish formal discussion around a potential proposal.

To create a Draft Proposal, [create a new governance proposal](https://github.com/ensdomains/governance-docs/new/main/governance-proposals) in the governance-docs repository on GitHub. Start by copying the template for an [executable proposal](executable-proposal-template.md), [social proposal](social-proposal-template.md), or [constitutional amendment](constitutional-amendment-template.md), as appropriate. Once you have written your proposal, create a Draft Pull Request for it. Start a new post in the DAO-wide -> Draft Proposals" category with a link to the PR for discussion.

Reach out to your network to build support for the proposal. Discuss the proposal and solicit delegates to provide feedback on it. Be willing to respond to questions on the Draft Proposal topic and in comments on the pull request. Share your viewpoint, although try to remain as impartial as possible.

If your proposal is an executable proposal, you will need to specify the actions your proposal will take while it is in draft stage. You may wish to wait until the proposal is stable before doing this. The executable proposal template explains how to do this.

If your proposal is a constitutional amendment, you will need to produce a diff showing the exact changes you are proposing to make. The easiest way to do this is to go to the [constitution](/dao/constitution), click "Edit on GitHub", then click the pencil icon to edit the document in a fork. You can then create a pull request via the GitHub UI and include this in your proposal. You should do this in a separate branch to your draft proposal; while the proposal will be merged as soon as it goes to a vote, the amendment will only be merged if the proposal passes.

Once you are confident the proposal is in a stable state, you can proceed to phase 3.

### **Phase 3: Active Proposal — Snapshot / Governance Portal**

Use GitHub to flag your PR as Ready for Review. A contributor will:

1. Merge your PR if it meets the requirements.
2. Assign your proposal a proposal number in the form EP###.
3. Schedule the proposal for a snapshot vote.

If your proposal is a Social Proposal or a Constitutional Amendment, that's it! If the snapshot vote passes, the proposal is passed and you are done.

If your proposal is an Executable Proposal, you will now need to submit it to the governor contract for voting onchain.

To enact an Executable Proposal:

1. Ensure at least 100k ENS is delegated to your address in order to submit a proposal, or find a delegate who has enough delegated ENS to meet the proposal threshold to propose on your behalf.
2. Call the propose() function of the ENS governor (at [governor.ensdao.eth](https://etherscan.io/address/0x323a76393544d5ecca80cd6ef2a560c6a395b7e3)) to deploy your proposal.

Once the propose() function has been called, a seven day voting period is started. Ongoing discussion can take place on your proposal post. If the proposal passes successfully, a two day timelock will follow before the proposed code is executed.

## **Governance Terminology**

**ENS**: An ERC-20 token that designates the weight of a user’s voting rights. The more ENS a user has in their wallet, the more weight their delegation or vote on a proposal holds.

**Delegation**: ENS holders cannot vote or create proposals until they delegate their voting rights to an address. Delegation can be given to one address at a time, including the holder’s own address. Note that delegation does not lock tokens; it simply adds votes to the chosen delegation address.

**Executable Proposal**: An executable proposal is a type of proposal that is executed by the governance contract through timelock. It can replace the governance contract, transfer tokens from the community treasury, or perform an almost infinite range of other on-chain actions. In order to create a proposal, an address must have at least 0.1% (100k ENS) of all ENS delegated to their address. Proposals are stored in the “proposals” mapping of the Governor smart contract. All proposals are subject to a 7-day voting period.

**Quorum**: In order for a vote to pass, a certain percentage of ENS tokens must vote in the affirmative. The current quorum requirements are:

- Executable Proposals: 1%
- Social Proposals: 1%
- Constitutional Amendments: 1%

The purpose of this quorum is to ensure that the only measures that pass have adequate voter participation.

**Voting on Executable Proposals**: Users can vote for or against single proposals once they have voting rights delegated to their address. Votes can be cast while a proposal is in the “Active” state. Votes can be submitted immediately using “castVote” or submitted later with “castVoteBySig” (For more info on castVoteBySig and offline signatures, see EIP-712). If the majority of votes (and a 1% quorum of ENS) vote for a proposal, the proposal may be queued in the Timelock.

**Voting Period**: Proposals on Snapshot have a 5 day voting period. Once an executable proposal has been put forward, ENS community members will have a seven day period (the Voting Period) to cast their votes.

**Timelock**: All governance actions are delayed for a minimum of 2 days by the timelock contract before they can be executed.

# ENS DAO Stewards

The DAO is governed through a democratic process in which all major matters are decided through a vote open to all holders of governance tokens. Those who wish can also delegate their voting power, entrusting somebody else to keep tabs on the latest DAO matters.

Delegates can be chosen or switched at any time, often without cost, via [Tally](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/ens), [Agora](https://agora.ensdao.org/) or other apps.

For more day-to-day matters, there are Stewards who are elected for a one-year term. The election happens every year on December 10 and lasts for 5 days. Stewards make decisions on governance, hold public meetings, and decide on grants, sponsorships, and other matters. Stewards are divided into different working groups, each reflecting their specific focus.

# ENS DAO Working Group Rules

_This document represents the current state of the Working Group Rules as created by [EP0.4](https://snapshot.box/#/s:ens.eth/proposal/0x899ead1d9b9b98f63f6a60dc0939bef55dbe365e78c6a550f07be969a47f148b), and amended by [EP1.8](https://snapshot.box/#/s:ens.eth/proposal/0xc7186cf8bebe47600f8d847e76f7971ea97b48bc04eda1e07780aff91fb6410d) and [EP4.8](https://snapshot.box/#/s:ens.eth/proposal/0x26a5c8dec547837495707e70446d1e7cd874a91f75753c602998f6e70083a266). These should represent the canonical version of the rules and any social proposal to amend it should include a PR to this document._

:::note
The numbering system of EP's was changed after Working Group rules were established, which is why the above proposals have different numbers than Snapshot displays.
:::

## 1. Formation of Working Groups

1.  To create a new working group, a social proposal, as defined by the ENS governance documentation ('Social Proposal'), must be put forward and passed by the DAO.
2.  A Social Proposal to create a new working group must demonstrate that the new working group is needed and the work cannot be undertaken within an existing working group.

## 2. Dissolution of Working Groups

1.  A working group can be dissolved by passing a Social Proposal requesting the dissolution of a working group or working groups.
2.  If an active proposal is put forward to dissolve a working group, all working group funds, including outgoing payments, within that working group, are to be frozen with immediate effect, pending the outcome of that vote.
3.  Upon the dissolution of a working group, any and all unspent working group funds from that working group, at the time of dissolution, must be immediately returned to the DAO treasury, without delay.

## 3. Working Group Stewards

1.  Each working group shall be managed by three stewards (hereafter a 'Steward' or 'Stewards').
2.  Stewards will be elected to serve within working groups for a set period of one calendar year (hereafter known as a 'Term').
3.  The Term for Stewards commences at 9am UTC on January 1 each year and ends immediately prior to the commencement of the Term of the following year.
4.  Stewards are responsible for overseeing the operation of working groups in accordance with these rules and the ENS DAO constitution.
5.  The responsibilities of Stewards include, but are not limited to:
    1. Requesting working group funds from the DAO in accordance with these rules;
    2. Approving the creation of sub-groups or workstreams within a working group to undertake work and/or carry out specific projects or tasks;
    3. Dissolving sub-groups or workstreams within a working group;
    4. Using discretion to make working group funds available to sub-groups, workstreams, or contributors within a working group;
    5. Using discretion to disburse working group funds to people and/or projects in accordance with the ENS DAO constitution; and
    6. Acting as keyholders of working group multi-sigs.

## 4. Steward Eligibility and Nominations

1.  Any individual is eligible to nominate themselves to be a Steward of a working group within the DAO ('Eligible Person').
2.  To be eligible for the election for the annual Term, Eligible Persons must nominate themselves between 9am UTC on December 6 and 9am UTC on December 9 ('Nomination Window').
3.  An Eligible Person may nominate themselves to become a Steward of a working group during the Nomination Window, by meeting the requirements set out in a call for nominations posted in the relevant working group category of the ENS governance forum.
4.  An Eligible Person who completes the steps outlined in rule 4.3 above during the Nomination Window and receives 10,000 signed votes to support their nomination will be included in the ballot as a nominee in the election for Stewards that takes place following that Nomination Window ('Nominee').

## 5. Steward Elections

1.  Elections for working group Stewards for the upcoming year will take place by a vote of governance token holders using signed messages and will be open for 120 hours, commencing at 9am UTC on December 10 each year ('Election Window').
2.  The top-ranked Nominees from the working group vote held during the Election Window will fill any available positions for the role of Steward for those working groups for the upcoming Term, based on the order in which they are ranked in the vote.
3.  A Nominee elected to serve as a Steward may not take up the role of Steward for more than two working groups during their Term.

## 6. Delay of Nominations or Elections

1.  In the event that nominations or elections for Stewards take place after a Nomination Window or after an Election Window, the nomination process and/or elections shall take place, as otherwise prescribed in rules 4 and 5 above, as soon as is practicable after the missed Nomination Window or missed Election Window.
2.  In the event that an election takes place outside of an Election Window and after the commencement date of a new Term, outgoing Stewards from the previous Term shall stay in their positions as working group Stewards until immediately prior to 9am UTC the day following the end of the election, which, for the avoidance of doubt, is 120 hours after voting in those elections commenced.
3.  In the event that an election takes place outside of an Election Window and after the commencement date of a new Term, newly elected Stewards will assume the responsibilities of stewardship within working groups at 9am UTC the day following the end of the election, as defined in rule 6.2 above, for the remainder of that Term.

## 7. Removal and Replacement of Stewards

1.  Stewards may be removed at any time by:
    1. a Social Proposal passed by the DAO; or
    2. a simple indicative majority vote among Stewards of all working groups, with the outcome of that vote communicated in the relevant working group category of the ENS governance forum.
2.  Stewards may step down from their position at any time by communicating their intention to step down in the ENS governance forum.
3.  In the event that a Steward is removed, steps down, or is unable to continue as a Steward, for whatever reason, prior to the end of a Term, a new election must be held to fill any vacant Steward positions, in accordance with rule 6 above.

## 8. Lead Stewards

1.  Each working group must appoint a lead Steward within the first five days of a Term (hereafter a 'Lead Steward' or 'Lead Stewards').
2.  Only current elected Stewards of a working group are eligible to serve as Lead Stewards within a given working group.
3.  Lead Stewards may be appointed or removed from that role at any time by a simple indicative majority vote among the Stewards of a working group, with the outcome of that vote communicated in the relevant working group category of the ENS governance forum.
4.  In the event that a Lead Steward steps down from the position or is removed as a Lead Steward before the end of a Term in accordance with rule 8.3 above, a new Lead Steward must be appointed within five calendar days.
5.  A Steward who is appointed to serve as a Lead Steward of a working group will remain in that position, as Lead Steward, from the date of appointment until the end of their elected Term as a Steward or until they are removed as a Lead Steward in accordance with rule 8.3 above or until they are removed as a Steward in accordance with rule 7 above.
6.  Lead Stewards are responsible for the operational management and administration of working groups and are expected to provide regular updates to the DAO in the ENS governance forum related to working group progress, achievements, and challenges.
7.  The responsibilities of Lead Stewards include, but are not limited to:
    1. Acting as a representative of a working group;
    2. Managing resource requests from sub-groups, workstreams, and contributors within a working group;
    3. Initiating the disbursement of working group funds on an as-needed basis;
    4. Providing reports of working group spending in the ENS governance forum; and
    5. Maintaining open communications with DAO participants in the ENS governance forum.

## 9. DAO Secretary

1.  At the start of each Term, the current Stewards of each working group shall collaborate to appoint an individual who will serve as the secretary of the DAO (hereafter 'Secretary' or 'Secretaries').
2.  The Secretary may be appointed or removed from that role at any time by a majority vote of all elected Stewards in a given Term with the outcome of that vote communicated in the ENS governance forum.
3.  The Secretary will remain in that position, as Secretary of the DAO, from the date of appointment until the end of a given Term or until the date at which they are removed from that position in accordance with rule 9.2 above.
4.  Secretaries are eligible to receive fair compensation for their work as Secretary of the DAO.
5.  Compensation for the Secretary of the DAO is to be paid by the Meta-Governance Working Group using funds requested in accordance with rule 10 below.
6.  Any individual is eligible to be appointed as the Secretary of the DAO, including past and present working group Stewards.
7.  The Secretary is responsible for managing working relationships and communications across working groups as well as performing administrative duties for the DAO.
8.  The responsibilities of the Secretary include, but are not limited to:
    1. Managing a DAO-wide calendar;
    2. Coordinating and attending working group meetings where possible and ensuring meeting summaries are posted in the ENS governance forum;
    3. Assisting Stewards with coordination challenges within working groups; and
    4. Acting as a multi-sig keyholder for each working group.

## 10. Working Group Funds

1. To request working group funds, Stewards of all working groups will collaborate to submit an active executable proposal, as defined by the ENS governance documentation ('Collective Proposal'), to the DAO during the months of January, April, July, and October each calendar year (each a 'Funding Window').
   1. In order for a working group to have a funding request included in a Collective Proposal submitted to the DAO during a Funding Window, the funding request must have passed as a Social Proposal in the same Funding Window.
   2. In the case of an emergency, where working group funds are needed by a working group outside of a Funding Window, an executable proposal, as defined by the ENS governance documentation, may be submitted at any time by a Steward of a working group to request funds from the DAO.
2. Working group funds requested and approved in accordance with rule 10.1 above are to be paid out into separate working group multi-sigs controlled by the DAO.
3. Each working group multi-sig must have four keyholders, made up of three current elected Stewards for that working group and the Secretary of the DAO for that Term, with no other keyholders permitted.
4. Working group funds may be disbursed from working group multi-sigs with three-of-four keyholder signing.
5. Stewards of a given working group shall have the discretion to reallocate funds approved in a Collective Proposal where appropriate and where it is not in conflict with any rules of the DAO, DAO bylaws, or the ENS DAO constitution.

## 11. Compensation for Stewards and Lead Stewards

1. Stewards are eligible to receive fair compensation for their work as a Steward or Lead Steward in the DAO.

# ENS DAO Constitution

The ENS constitution is a set of binding rules that determine what governance actions are legitimate for the DAO to take.

Each article has examples of permissible and non permissible actions. These examples are illustrative and should not be considered a binding part of the text of the constitution itself.

## I. Name ownership shall not be infringed

ENS governance will not enact any change that infringes on the rights of ENS users to retain names they own, or unfairly discriminate against name owners' ability to extend, transfer, or otherwise use their names.

### **Examples**

**Permissible**: ENS governance may enact a change affecting the registration or extension costs of all names based on transparent criteria such as length, as long as it pursues a goal outlined in this constitution.

**Not Permissible**: ENS governance must not enact a change increasing or reducing the extension costs of a list of existing ENS names, as this would unfairly benefit or penalise a handpicked group.

## II. Fees are primarily an incentive mechanism

The primary purpose of registration fees is as an incentive mechanism to prevent the namespace becoming overwhelmed with speculatively registered names. A secondary purpose is to provide enough revenue to the DAO to fund ongoing development and improvement of ENS. ENS governance will not enact any fee other than for these purposes.

### **Examples**

**Permissible**: ENS governance may increase the price of name registrations in order to address excessive speculative registrations induced by a price that is set too low, or because the current price is insufficient to fund ongoing ENS operations at a reasonable level.

**Not Permissible**: ENS governance must not enact a change imposing a fee for claiming DNS domains inside ENS, because such a fee would be purely an income generating measure and not an incentive mechanism.

## III. Income funds ENS and other public goods

Any income generated to the ENS treasury is to be used first of all to ensure the long-term viability of ENS, and to fund continuing development and improvement of the ENS system. Funds that are not reasonably required to achieve this goal may be used to fund other public goods within web3 as ENS governance sees fit.

ENS governance will not allocate funds to a team or individual who does not commit to uphold the same principles outlined in this constitution in their use of the allocated funds.

### **Examples**

**Permissible**: ENS governance may offer grant funding for a public good unrelated to ENS or Ethereum, so long as doing so does not affect the long-term viability of ENS.

**Not Permissible**: ENS governance must not use the funds to support projects that conflict with the goals of ENS.

## IV. ENS Integrates with the global namespace

In order to facilitate making the most widely usable naming system, ENS aims to integrate with the legacy DNS naming system to the greatest extent possible without sacrificing decentralization of ENS. ENS governance will not enact changes that compromise ENS's ability to do this.

### **Examples**

**Permissible**: ENS governance should grant control of a top-level domain to its owner in the DNS system on request.

**Not permissible**: ENS governance must not create new top-level domains unless those domains have been granted to ENS by a DNS authority.

## V. Amendments to this constitution by majority vote

Any change may be made to this constitution only by two-thirds majority and at least 1% of all tokens participating.

# The ENS Foundation

## Why have a legal entity?

Having a legal entity that represents the DAO in the "real world" is valuable for a number of reasons:

- It provides limited liability to DAO participants for the actions of the DAO. Without a legal entity, participants may be individually held liable for anything the DAO as a whole does.
- It is capable of complying with taxation requirements - without a legal entity, DAO participants may be held liable for a proportion of the DAO's income, even if they are not able to access these funds.
- It is capable of entering into contracts with other "real world" entities, of holding assets (including IP rights), and so forth.

For a more detailed discussion of this topic, see [this excellent blog post](https://mirror.xyz/0x954888B7a5C6736F4955dF18B556D8328FD02f61/5K9llACK4tzu5WHL68CM3bBsmSleL_XxJ2kRGYnwp7A).

## What is The ENS Foundation?

The ENS Foundation is a Foundation Company Limited By Guarantee, incorporated in the Cayman Islands. Foundation companies are nonprofits; The ENS Foundation has no shareholders and cannot pay out dividends to its directors or members. For more details on how foundations work, see [this article](https://www.careyolsen.com/briefings/overview-cayman-islands-foundation-companies).

The ENS Foundation has three directors: Nick Johnson, Kevin Gaspar, and Alex Van de Sande. Directors are in charge of the day-to-day running of the foundation.

The ENS Foundation has one supervisor. The supervisor is an administrative role whose job is to make sure that the directors are doing their jobs in accordance with Cayman Islands law. The position of supervisor is filled by a Cayman Islands firm, DS Limited.

The ENS Foundation's Articles of Incorporation give significant powers to the ENS DAO (referred to as "The Council" in the Articles). The DAO may vote to:

- Appoint or remove a director, member, or supervisor.
- Prohibit admitting any members in future.
- Instruct the directors to wind up the foundation, and specify what charity or other foundation should receive the foundation's assets.

Though not specified directly in the Articles, the DAO may also instruct the directors to take action on behalf of the Foundation - such as signing a contract, engaging a company for a service the DAO requires, or delegating some of the directors' powers to a DAO working group.

## Foundation Expenses

Running a Foundation is not free, and comes with some real-world costs. An incomplete list of anticipated expenses includes:

- Registered Office & Secretary Services: $10,000 USD p/a
- Supervisory Services: $30,000 USD p/a
- Agent for service of process: $1,200 USD p/a
- Companies Register Fees: $850 USD p/a

The Directors may ask the DAO for reimbursement of these fees when they are incurred so that the Foundation can continue to operate.

## Documents

For transparency, important documents relating to the Foundation can be found below. Meeting minutes, resolutions, accounts, and other documentation will be uploaded here as it is made available to the directors.

# The ENS Token

:::info
ENS Airdropped tokens to anyone who held an ENS name on _October 31st, 2021_.
**THERE ARE NO PLANS FOR ANOTHER AIRDROP**. Please be weary of any notices of
airdrops as these could turn out fraudulent.
:::

All major decisions of the ENS DAO governance rely on the ENS Governance Token, which was distributted to ENS owners in 2021. The token can be found at [token.ensdao.eth](https://etherscan.io/address/token.ensdao.eth) on Ethereum Mainnet and is the only official governance token for ENS DAO.

The $ENS token allocation can be seen in the pie chart below.

![ENS token distribution](/img/token-distribution.png)

## Can I recover tokens accidentally sent to the wrong address?

The answer depends on the address the token was sent to.

- If you accidentally sent the token to [token.ensdao.eth](https://etherscan.io/address/token.ensdao.eth) or [wallet.ensdao.eth](https://etherscan.io/address/wallet.ensdao.eth), then it might be recoverable. Contact the [Meta-governance working group](/dao/stewards/) and explain the situation.

- If the tokens were sent to the null address (0x000...0000) or an address with a typo, then the tokens are unrecoverable and there's nothing that anyone can do.

- If the tokens were sent to an exchange or a third party, then contact that third party for help.

The ENS DAO Security Council is a 4-of-8 multi-sig with a limited mandate: to cancel malicious proposals that threaten the DAO, particularly those that would compromise the treasury. It was created to address vulnerabilities stemming from low voter participation relative to treasury size.

## Purpose and Powers

The security council is expected to act only in emergency, in the given following situations or similar cases:

- If a proposal goes against the [ENS Constitution](/dao/constitution)
- If a proposal is approved with malicious intent against the DAO longevity/sustainability
- If such [a] proposal is approved by any group of voters, but [they are] directly financially incentivised to vote against the DAO's interests to preserve their own financial stake
- If any approved proposal goes directly against the DAO for the sole benefit of an attacker

The council cannot propose, amend, or otherwise initiate governance actions.

## Time-Limited Authority

The Security Council's cancel authority is time-limited. Two years after deployment (at unix timestamp `1784919179`), any address may call `renounceTimelockRoleByExpiration()` to permanently disable the cancel role, promoting decentralisation over time.

## Relevant Proposals

The veto was first introduced in [Introducing veto.ensdao.eth](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/introducing-veto-ensdao-eth/19088), and approved via social proposal [EP 5.7](/dao/proposals/5.7). Additional discussion occured in [Enable the cancel role on the DAO](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/temp-check-enable-cancel-role-on-the-dao/19090). Member appointments were confirmed in social proposal [EP 5.10](/dao/proposals/5.10), and the Security Council was formally implemented in Executable [EP 5.13](/dao/proposals/5.13).

## Contract Details

[`SecurityCouncil.sol`](https://github.com/blockful-io/security-council-ens) is deployed to [0xb8fa0ce3f91f41c5292d07475b445c35ddf63ee0](https://etherscan.io/address/0xb8fa0ce3f91f41c5292d07475b445c35ddf63ee0) on Ethereum Mainnet. It is owned by the [4-of-8 multi-sig](https://etherscan.io/address/0xaA5cD05f6B62C3af58AE9c4F3F7A2aCC2Cdc2Cc7) specified in [EP 5.10](/dao/proposals/5.10).

# Quickstart

Hey there 👋, this is the quickstart guide. If you want to learn the process checkout [everything about ENS in dApps](/web/).
If you would rather just clone an example repository checkout these:

## Starter Kits

<ConnectKits />

## Add to your dApp

This quickstart guide assumes you have a basic understanding of React.

### Installation

```bash [Terminal]
npm install wagmi viem @tanstack/react-query
```

### Showing the User Profile

The below codesnippet demonstrates how you can create a basic user profile section that shows the users ENS name and avatar.
The snippet leverages the [useAccount](https://wagmi.sh/react/hooks/useAccount), [useEnsName](https://wagmi.sh/react/hooks/useEnsName), and [useEnsAvatar](https://wagmi.sh/react/hooks/useEnsAvatar) hooks from wagmi.

<Card className="flex flex-col items-center justify-center gap-2 sm:flex-row">
  <EnsProfile name="nick.eth" />
  <EnsProfile name="jefflau.eth" />
  <EnsProfile name="vitalik.eth" />
</Card>

```tsx
import { useAccount, useEnsAvatar, useEnsName } from 'wagmi'

export const EnsProfile = () => {
  const { address } = useAccount()
  const { data: name } = useEnsName({ address, chainId: 1 })
  const { data: avatar } = useEnsAvatar({ name, chainId: 1 })

  return (
    <div className="flex items-center gap-2">
      <img src={avatar} className="h-8 w-8 rounded-full" />
      <div className="flex flex-col leading-none">
        <span className="font-semibold">{name}</span>
        <span className="text-grey text-sm">{address}</span>
      </div>
    </div>
  )
}
```

:::info
ENS resolution always starts from L1 regardless of the chain the user is connected to. This is why we specify `chainId: 1` for Ethereum Mainnet in the wagmi hooks above.

# Subdomains

We believe that any place an address is used, a name should be able to be used instead.
The smart contracts you interact with have names, the deposit address for your favorite exchange has a name, your favorite DAO has a name, or maybe you use subnames to keep your wallets organized.

<Card className="flex items-center justify-center text-xl">
  <div className="text-right font-bold">
    {['root', 'registrar', 'controller', 'resolver', 'registry'].map(
      (subname, i) => (
        <div
          className={
            ['opacity-20', 'opacity-50', '', 'opacity-50', 'opacity-20'][i]
          }
          key={subname}
        >
          {subname}
        </div>
      )
    )}
  </div>
  <div className="text-blue font-bold">.ens.eth</div>
</Card>

Luckily, the ENS Protocol has so much to offer for you to play with. There are a variety of ways you can give out subdomains to your apps users, set them up for yourself, or more.

If you are interested in naming smart contracts specifically, check out the [Naming Smart Contracts](/web/naming-contracts) page.

## Different Types of Subnames

ENS subnames come in a variety of forms: L1, L2, and offchain. From a technical perspective, L2 and offchain subnames are quite similar, but there are some tradeoffs to consider when choosing which one to use.

### L1 Subnames

If you own a .eth name like nick.eth and go to create a subname in [the manager app](https://app.ens.domains/nick.eth?tab=subnames), you will be creating a subname on Ethereum Mainnet (L1) by default. This is the simplest way to create a subname with the least amount of moving pieces, but ultimately you are limited by the gas fees of Ethereum Mainnet.

If you'd like to issue L1 subnames to your users, read our guide on [creating an onchain subname registrar](/wrapper/creating-subname-registrar).

<EmbedLink
  title="Creating an Onchain Subname Registrar"
  href="/wrapper/creating-subname-registrar"
  description="Issue NFTs that represent subdomains on Ethereum Mainnet."
/>

### L2 Subnames

Developers can connect an ENS name on L1 with their own smart contracts on any L2 network, and [depending on the implementation](/learn/ccip-read), this could be fully trustless while significantly reducing the cost of issuing subnames.

[Durin](https://durin.dev/) is an opinionated approach to issuing ENS subnames on L2. It takes care of the L1 Resolver and offchain gateway parts of the [CCIP Read stack](/resolvers/ccip-read) for you, so you can focus on the business logic of your L2 smart contracts.

<EmbedLink
  title="Durin"
  href="https://durin.dev/"
  description="An opinionated approach to issuing ENS subnames on L2."
/>

### Offchain Subnames

Offchain subnames are exactly what they sound like - subnames that live in a centralized database on private servers, also powered by [CCIP Read](/resolvers/ccip-read). If your goal is to name a large amount of EVM addresses quickly and cheaply, with a low barrier to entry, offchain subnames might be for you. Often times, managing offchain names is as simple as interacting with a REST API.

From a user perspective, offchain subnames are hardly different than onchain subnames. They will not appear in wallet applications as NFTs like the previous two approaches, but they can resolve all the same data (addresses, text records, etc).

There are multiple API providers that offer programmatic access to offchain subnames such as [NameStone](https://namestone.com/) and [Namespace](https://namespace.ninja/), along with open-source examples like [gskril/ens-offchain-registrar](https://github.com/gskril/ens-offchain-registrar).

# Primary Names

We can all agree 42-character long machine-optimized addresses (eg. 0x225...c3b5) are not aesthetically pleasing.
Fortunately, it is super easy to retrieve a user's preferred name, and this page will show you how.

<Card className="flex items-center justify-center gap-2">
  <span className="font-medium">0xb8c...67d5</span>
  <span>to</span>
  <EnsProfile name="nick.eth" hideAddress />
</Card>

In order to convert them to human-readable names, we use [the reverse registrar](/registry/reverse).
The reverse registrar is a smart contract that allows users to register their preferred name, referred to as their "primary name" for simplicity purposes.

This functionality exists on Mainnet Ethereum today, and is [coming soon to L2s](#l2-primary-names) as well.

## Getting a Primary Name

:::info
**Important**: After retrieving a name from reverse resolution, you **must** verify it by performing a forward resolution on that name to confirm it still resolves to the original address. This prevents spoofing or misconfiguration. If the addresses don't match, display the original address instead of the name.
:::

Looking up a users primary name is very simple. In most web3 libraries (wagmi, viem, ethers, web3py, etc.), you will find a built-in function to do a lookup by address as shown below. In most cases, the library will handle the verification for you.

Note that all ENS requests are made from Ethereum Mainnet, even if your application is on an L2.

:::code-group

```tsx [Wagmi]
// https://wagmi.sh/react/hooks/useEnsName
import { useEnsName } from 'wagmi'
import { mainnet } from 'wagmi/chains'

export const Name = () => {
  const { data: name } = useEnsName({
    address: '0xb8c2C29ee19D8307cb7255e1Cd9CbDE883A267d5',
    chainId: mainnet.id, // resolution always starts from L1
  })

  return <div>Name: {name}</div>
}
```

```ts [Ethers v5]
const address = '0xb8c2C29ee19D8307cb7255e1Cd9CbDE883A267d5';
const name = await provider.lookupAddress(address);

// Always verify the forward resolution
if (name) {
    const resolvedAddress = await provider.resolveName(name);
    if (resolvedAddress !== address) {
        // If verification fails, use the original address
        return address;
    }
}
```

```ts [Viem]
// https://viem.sh/docs/ens/actions/getEnsName.html
import { publicClient } from './client'

const ensName = await publicClient.getEnsName({
  address: '0xb8c2C29ee19D8307cb7255e1Cd9CbDE883A267d5',
})
```

```py [Web3.py]
# https://web3py.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ens_overview.html#get-the-ens-name-for-an-address
from ens.auto import ns

name = ns.name('0xb8c2C29ee19D8307cb7255e1Cd9CbDE883A267d5')
```

```go [Go]
package main

import (
	"fmt"

	"github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/common"
	"github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/ethclient"
	ens "github.com/wealdtech/go-ens/v3"
)

func main() {
	client, _ := ethclient.Dial("https://rpc.ankr.com/eth")

	name, _ := ens.ReverseResolve(client, common.HexToAddress("0xb8c2C29ee19D8307cb7255e1Cd9CbDE883A267d5"))
	fmt.Println("Name:", name)
	// Name: nick.eth
}
```

🎉 And that's it! Now you can turn all your pages from this, to this:

<Card className="flex flex-col items-center gap-2">
  <div className="flex items-center gap-2">
    <Badge>0xb8c2...67d5</Badge>

  </div>

## Setting Primary Names

In some cases you might want to encourage users to set their primary name. This might be in the event you are issuing names, or want people to be part of a community.

To do so, you can use the `setName()` function on the [reverse registrar contract](/learn/deployments).

## L2 Primary Names

:::warning
Primary names are currently only supported on Ethereum Mainnet. Soon, primary names are also coming to L2s and are already available on testnets. This will make it possible for users to have an end-to-end experience with ENS on L2.
:::

New contracts will be deployed to popular L2s (starting with Base, OP Mainnet, Arbitrum, Linea, and Scroll) that allow users to declare a name as their primary onchain identity. The contract interface will look something like this (not finalized):

```solidity
/// @notice Sets the `name()` record for the reverse ENS record associated with the calling account.
/// @param name The name to set
/// @return The ENS node hash of the reverse record
function setName(string memory name) external returns (bytes32);

/// @notice Sets the `name()` record for the reverse ENS record associated with the addr provided account.
///         Can be used if the addr is a contract that is owned by an SCA.
/// @param addr The address to set the name for
/// @param name The name to set
/// @return The ENS node hash of the reverse record
function setNameForAddr(
    address addr,
    string memory name
) external returns (bytes32);

/// @notice Sets the `name()` record for the reverse ENS record associated with the contract provided that is owned with `Ownable`.
/// @param contractAddr The address of the contract to set the name for (implementing Ownable)
/// @param owner The owner of the contract (via Ownable)
/// @param name The name to set
/// @param coinTypes The coin types to set. Must be inclusive of the coin type for the contract
/// @param signatureExpiry The expiry of the signature
/// @param signature The signature of an address that will return true on isValidSignature for the owner
/// @return The ENS node hash of the reverse record
function setNameForOwnableWithSignature(
    address contractAddr,
    address owner,
    string calldata name,
    uint256[] memory coinTypes,
    uint256 signatureExpiry,
    bytes calldata signature
) external returns (bytes32);

/// @notice Sets the `name()` record for the reverse ENS record associated with the addr provided account using a signature.
/// @param addr The address to set the name for
/// @param name The name of the reverse record
/// @param coinTypes The coin types to set. Must be inclusive of the coin type for the contract
/// @param signatureExpiry Date when the signature expires
/// @param signature The signature from the addr
/// @return The ENS node hash of the reverse record
function setNameForAddrWithSignature(
    address addr,
    string calldata name,
    uint256[] calldata coinTypes,
    uint256 signatureExpiry,
    bytes calldata signature
) external returns (bytes32);
```

This provides multiple ways to set a primary name, usable for EOAs or smart contracts which is a big improvement over the current L1-only implementation.

After retrieving a name from L2 reverse resolution, you must verify it by performing a forward resolution for the corresponding cointype on that name to confirm it still resolves to the original address. Let's look at an example:

Say I own gregskril.eth on mainnet. The name resolves to my EOA `0x179A...9285` because I've set the ETH address for that name. I call `setName("gregskril.eth")` on the Base reverse registrar, and I expect that my primary name is now `gregskril.eth` on Base. But that's actually not the case.

ENS names can resolve to [different addresses on different chains](/web/resolution), and since gregskril.eth in the example above has only specified an ETH address, the verification process will fail. In order to fix this, I need to set the Base address for gregskril.eth which is on L1 in this case. This is done by calling `setAddr(namehash("gregskril.eth"), 0x179A...9285)` on the resolver for the name.

Now that gregskril.eth resolves to `0x179A...9285` when using the Base cointype, and `name(0x179A...9285)` on the Base reverse registrar returns `gregskril.eth`, my primary name is fully set.

### L2 Reverse Registrar Deployments

:::note
The final deployment addresses will be different from the ones below. These are only for testnets.
:::

| L2 Testnet Chain | Address                                    |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Base Sepolia     | 0x00000BeEF055f7934784D6d81b6BC86665630dbA |
| OP Sepolia       | 0x00000BeEF055f7934784D6d81b6BC86665630dbA |
| Arbitrum Sepolia | 0x00000BeEF055f7934784D6d81b6BC86665630dbA |
| Scroll Sepolia   | 0x00000BeEF055f7934784D6d81b6BC86665630dbA |
| Linea Sepolia    | 0x00000BeEF055f7934784D6d81b6BC86665630dbA |

{/* Slightly rewritten from https://github.com/ensdomains/ens-contracts/tree/feature/simplify-reverse-resolver/contracts/reverseRegistrar */}

### Setting Records

On these chains, you can set a primary name for the sender in a few ways:

- `setName()` most simply, using the `msg.sender`'s address
- `setNameForAddr()` for smart contracts that implement the Ownable pattern, where `owner() == msg.sender`
- `setNameForAddrWithSignature()` for EOAs or smart contracts with an ERC-1271 or ERC-6492 signature to set a reverse record on behalf of a user
- `setNameForOwnableWithSignature()` which combines the functionality of the previous two functions to set the reverse record on behalf of a smart contract that implements `Ownable`

### Signatures for setting records

The signature format for `setNameForAddrWithSignature` is:

```
validatorAddress, // 0xAe91c512BC1da8B00cd33dd9D9C734069e6E0fcd for testnets
functionSignature, // 0x2023a04c
name, // string name value
addr, // address to set name for
coinTypes, // array of coinTypes wanting to be set
signatureExpiry // expiry of the signature, up to 1 hour in the future
```

The signature format for `setNameForOwnableWithSignature` is:

```
validatorAddress, // 0xAe91c512BC1da8B00cd33dd9D9C734069e6E0fcd for testnets
functionSignature, // 0x975713ad
name, // string name value
contractAddr, // contract address to set name for
owner, // owner address of contract (i.e. the signature being verified)
coinTypes, // array of coinTypes wanting to be set
signatureExpiry // expiry of the signature, up to 1 hour in the future
```

## Do's and Dont's

Under no situation is it recommended to force a user to change their primary name, nor doing so without clearly notifying the user of what the transaction they are about to execute could modify.

Doing so could be seen as hostile or undesired behaviour by end users and might degrade their experience with your app.

# Avatars

Personalization of profiles is what makes identity great.
This page covers the very special **avatar** record that enables users to take their avatar with them across the web.

<Card className="flex justify-center">
  <EnsProfile name="nick.eth" hideAddress />
</Card>

## Getting the user's Avatar

Avatars are an awesome way for users to express themselves. To get the user's avatar, all you need is their **name**. If you only have their address, see [primary names](/web/reverse#get).
The following code snippets let you get the avatar for a user.

:::code-group

```tsx [Wagmi]
// https://wagmi.sh/react/hooks/useEnsAvatar
import { useEnsAvatar } from 'wagmi'

function App() {
  const { data: ensAvatar } = useEnsAvatar({
    address: 'nick.eth',
    chainId: 1, // (1 = Ethereum Mainnet, 11155111 = Sepolia)
  })

  return (
    <img
      src={ensAvatar || 'https://avatars.jakerunzer.com/nick.eth'}
      alt="nick.eth"
    />
  )
}
```

```ts [Ethers]
// https://docs.ethers.org/v5/api/providers/provider/#Provider-getAvatar
const ensAvatar = await provider.getAvatar('nick.eth')
```

```ts [Viem]
// https://viem.sh/docs/ens/actions/getEnsAvatar.html
import { normalize } from 'viem/ens'

import { publicClient } from './client'

const ensAvatar = await publicClient.getEnsAvatar({
  name: normalize('nick.eth'),
})
```

```py [Web3.py]
# https://web3py.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ens_overview.html#read-text-metadata-for-an-ens-record
from ens.auto import ns

avatar = ns.get_text('alice.eth', 'avatar')
```

```go [Go]
package main

import (
	"fmt"

	"github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/ethclient"
	ens "github.com/wealdtech/go-ens/v3"
)

func main() {
	client, _ := ethclient.Dial("https://rpc.ankr.com/eth")

	domain, _ := ens.Normalize("nick.eth")
	resolver, _ := ens.NewResolver(client, domain)
	avatar, _ := resolver.Text("avatar")

	fmt.Println("Avatar: ", avatar)
}
```

:::

### The Metadata Service

The [metadata service](https://metadata.ens.domains/docs) is run by ENS Labs. It is a free service web service that allows you to retrieve the
avatar of an ENS name via a web request, as opposed to adding extra logic to your application and interacting
with an ethereum node. This is of course centralised and should be used if absolutely necessary.

## What exactly is an Avatar Record?

An avatar record is simply a [text record](/web/records) that has "avatar" as its key and a URI as its value,
with some rules about what URI schemes are supported and how to process them. For more info, see [ENSIP-11](/ensip/12).

## Supported URI schemes

Clients are expected to support a number of URI schemas, which aren't always web URIs, so the final result you see in your application
will vary depending on how the library you are using has decided to handle avatar records.

- `http(s):` - URI Scheme for HTTP(S) URLs. Libraries will most likely return the result directly.
- `ipfs:` - URI scheme for [IPFS hashes](). Libraries may decide to fetch the result from a public gateway for you.
- `data:` - URI Scheme for [data URIs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Basics_of_HTTP/Data_URLs).
  Libraries will most likely return the result directly.
- `eip155:` - The URI scheme for EIP-155 identifiers for linking to NFTs on Ethereum based chains. A little complicated
  to resolve manually, most libraries should resolve this for you and return the underlying resource.

:::note
For EIP-155 NFT Avatars the nft must be owned by the wallet address the ENS
name resolves to. This is done by checking the `ownerOf` method on the NFT
contract.
:::

## Common schemes that aren't officially supported

- `ethereum:` - The URI scheme for Ethereum addresses
- `bzz:` - The URI scheme for Swarm hashes

## File Information

Avatars come in many different shapes and sizes. Not just the above URI schemas, but also in different file formats, sizes, and more.
Although standards exist for some of these, files are **not required** to follow these standards.

Below is some information about the avatars your app might be loading.

| FileProperty:  | Info/Recommendation                                                             |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| File Extension | Mostly `png`, `jpeg`, `jpg`, `webp`, `gif`, `webm`, but could be anything       |
| File Size      | We recommend having sensible timeouts                                           |
| Aspect Ratio   | We recommend `object-fit: cover` or setting a background color                  |
| Transparency   | We recommend setting a background color as some images may contain transparency |

Luckily most browsers and network libraries have default timeouts to start with, we highly recommend that if you are doing any manual avatar downloading or fetching you add a sensible timeout.

# Listing a Users Names

In some cases you might want to show off all names that a user owns. Due to the nature of how the ENS Protocol works under the hood, this might be a slightly more difficult task than expected.

Fortunately, tooling has been developed to accommodate for this and to make it easier.

## Why not all names?

Not all ENS names exist onchain ([learn more about wildcard resolution](/ensip/10)), meaning we don't always know which names a user owns/controls.

The notable exception is [second-level](/terminology#first-layer) [.eth names](/registry/eth). Ownership of these names are onchain and indexable through scanning events on the appropriate smart contracts. Note that this does not necessarily mean address and text records associated with the name are onchain ([read more about offchain resolvers](/resolvers/ccip-read)).

## Guidelines

When using one of the methods described below it is important to keep in mind that you should always allow for a user to manually enter a name, as not all names are indexable.

It is generally recommended to allow users to input a name using an [input box](/web/design#2-resolving-input-fields) and to verify it resolves to the correct address upon user-completion.

## The Graph

The [ENS subgraph](/web/subgraph) indexes all events from relevant smart contracts and exposes them via a GraphQL endpoint. Note that addresses in filters must be lowercased.

ENSjs makes it easy to run common queries on the subgraph with strong type safety. Docs can be found [here](https://github.com/ensdomains/ensjs/tree/main/docs/subgraph).

```graphql
{
  domains(where: { owner: "0x225f137127d9067788314bc7fcc1f36746a3c3b5" }) {
    name
  }
  wrappedDomains(
    where: { owner: "0x225f137127d9067788314bc7fcc1f36746a3c3b5" }
  ) {
    name
  }
}

# Sign In With Ethereum (SIWE) [A specification that leverages ethereum signatures to perform authentication]

## Specification ([see spec](todo-link))

The SIWE Specification is rather simple. It describes a message format that a user ought to sign using their keys to be able to sign-in.
The message MUST include [a subject](todo-link), [nonce](todo-link), and a [timestamp](todo-link). These parameters prevent replay-attacks, cross-site usage, and more, all while maintaining a very human readable form.

An example payload looks like the following:

```
localhost wants you to sign in with your Ethereum account:
0x225f137127d9067788314bc7fcc1f36746a3c3B5

This is a test statement.

URI: https://localhost/login
Version: 1
Chain ID: 1
Nonce: abcdef1234567890
Issued At: 2023-01-30T00:00:00.000Z
```

## Implementations

The team at [SpruceID](https://login.xyz) has done a phenomenal job writing plug-and-play utilities that let you easily integrate ethereum-based authentication into your project.
Whether you are using [Next.js](todo-link), [React](todo-link), or [OpenID Connect](todo-link).

In addition to the above SIWE has been integrated into [connectkit](todo-link) & more.

# Naming Contracts [Learn how to name your smart contracts with ENS]

While it's commonly known that regular user accounts can have [primary names](/web/reverse), it's less known that smart contracts can also have names.

In order for you to manage the primary name of your smart contract, you need to own the [reverse node](/terminology#reverse-node) for the contract address. There are several ways of doing this, depending on if you are actively developing your contract or if it is already deployed.

:::note
To enable reverse resolution, you must set both the reverse record and the ETH address to the contract’s deployed address.
:::

Skip to [Naming Tools](#naming-tools) for a frontend solution to naming your smart contracts.

## New Contracts

Depending on your use case, there are a few ways to set a smart contract's primary name.

If you want to be able to change the name later, you have two options:

- **(Recommended)** Make the contract [Ownable](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/5.x/access-control) and set yourself as the owner.
- Take ownership of the reverse node (`{address}.addr.reverse`) for the contract.

The Ownable method is preferred since it's widely used and works well with Etherscan.

For contracts without admin permissions, you can set the reverse name in the constructor. This name can't be changed later.

Let's look at a few examples.

### ReverseClaimer.sol

:::note
While this method works perfectly at the ENS protocol level, Etherscan does not index the contract events correctly so it may not appear in their UI.
:::

This is a simple drop-in module that transfers ownership of the reverse node to an address of your choice, which can then update the reverse name at any time.

```solidity
import "@ensdomains/ens-contracts/contracts/registry/ENS.sol";
import "@ensdomains/ens-contracts/contracts/reverseRegistrar/ReverseClaimer.sol";

contract MyContract is ReverseClaimer {
    constructor (
        ENS ens
    ) ReverseClaimer(ens, msg.sender) {}
}
```

When you deploy your contract, the deployer account (`msg.sender`) will be given ownership of the reverse node for that contract address. This gives you authorization to call `setName(node, newName)` on the latest public resolver ([resolver.ens.eth](https://etherscan.io/address/resolver.ens.eth)), where `node` is the reverse node for the contract address and `newName` is the name you want to set it to.

To find the reverse node for your contract address, you can use the following viem script:

```ts
import { Hex, keccak256 } from 'viem'
import { namehash } from 'viem/ens'

function getNodeFromParentNodeAndLabelhash(parentNode: Hex, labelhash: Hex) {
  return keccak256((parentNode + labelhash.split('0x')[1]) as Hex)
}

const myContractAddress = '0x...' // replace with your contract address

const node = getNodeFromParentNodeAndLabelhash(
  namehash('addr.reverse'),
  labelhash(myContractAddress.slice(2).toLowerCase())
)

console.log(node)
```

### Ownable (recommended)

:::note
An example of this is [ownable.contract.gtest.eth](https://etherscan.io/address/ownable.contract.gtest.eth#code)
:::

If you want to be able to change the name in the future, you can make your smart contract [Ownable](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/5.x/api/access#Ownable).

```solidity
import {Ownable} from "@openzeppelin/contracts/access/Ownable.sol";

contract Contract is Ownable {
    constructor(address initialOwner) Ownable(initialOwner) {}
}
```

The [ReverseRegistrar](/registry/reverse) supports the Ownable interface and will let the `owner` of a contract set its primary name without having to add any ENS-specific code.

Once this contract is deployed, call `setNameForAddr(address, address, address, string)` on the Reverse Registrar ([reverse.ens.eth](https://etherscan.io/address/reverse.ens.eth)) from your authorized owner account.

- The first address argument is the address of your contract
- The second address argument is the owner of your smart contract
- The third address argument is the `defaultResolver()` from the Reverse Registrar
- The fourth argument is the ENS name to set it to

### Set a name in the constructor

:::note
An example of this [contract.gtest.eth](https://etherscan.io/address/contract.gtest.eth#code)
:::

If you don't want to be able to change the name in the future, you can inherit the following contract and assign an ENS name directly in the constructor.

```solidity
//SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.21;

interface ENS {
    function owner(bytes32 node) external view returns (address);
}

interface IReverseRegistrar {
    function setName(string memory name) external returns (bytes32);
}

// Variation of ReverseClaimer.sol from @ensdomains/ens-contracts that sets the reverse name directly.
contract ReverseSetter {
    /// @dev The ENS registry
    ENS private constant ens = ENS(0x00000000000C2E074eC69A0dFb2997BA6C7d2e1e);

    /// @dev Output of namehash("addr.reverse")
    bytes32 private constant ADDR_REVERSE_NODE =
        0x91d1777781884d03a6757a803996e38de2a42967fb37eeaca72729271025a9e2;

    /// @param name The reverse name to set for this contract's address.
    constructor(string memory name) {
        IReverseRegistrar reverseRegistrar = IReverseRegistrar(
            ens.owner(ADDR_REVERSE_NODE)
        );
        reverseRegistrar.setName(name);
    }
}
```

Using this in your contract is as simple as:

```solidity
import {ReverseSetter} from "./ReverseSetter.sol";

contract Contract is ReverseSetter {
    constructor(string memory name) ReverseSetter(name) {}
}
```

## Existing Contracts

If your contract is already deployed you might still be able to set a name for it.
If your contract supports the [Ownable](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/5.x/api/access#Ownable) interface from OpenZeppelin, read the section above.

### Safe, Multisig & DAO

If your contract is a Safe, Multisig, DAO, or has a function that can send arbitrary ETH calls, you can use the [ReverseRegistrar](/registry/reverse) contract directly to set a name for it.
You might even be able to use the [ENS Manager App](https://ens.app/) inside of your safe app to set a primary name.

## Naming Tools

:::warning
These are 3rd party tools and not officially supported by ENS Labs.
:::

[Enscribe](https://app.enscribe.xyz/) is a tool designed to simplify the process of naming smart contracts with ENS names. The application enables users to deploy new smart contracts with a primary name directly and easily name existing smart contracts.

Enscribe simplifies what is otherwise a multi-step, error-prone process by offering:

- Atomic contract deployment using `CREATE2`
- Naming `Ownable`, `ERC173`, `ReverseClaimer` and `ReverseSetter` contracts as described above
- ENS subname creation, forward resolution and reverse record assignment
- Naming of existing contracts, with an easy way to locate contracts that you've already deployed

Even if you don't own an ENS name, you can still utilize Enscribe's hosted ENS parent, `deployd.eth`, to create subnames like `my-app.deployd.eth` and set them as the primary name for your contract.

To learn more, refer to the [Enscribe Docs](https://www.enscribe.xyz/docs/).

# Design Guidelines [Guidelines for designing interfaces that use ENS names]

ENS is a tool to simplify the experience for your users by making blockchain addresses human-readable.
Here are a series of guidelines and tools that will help you make good design choices and better implement ENS in your product.

## When to show ENS names

In every instance where a user might otherwise see an Ethereum address, you can instead display an ENS name (with its avatar, if relevant).
This is true for both read and write operations.

An example of read operations where it's appropriate to show an ENS name is the connected wallet status or representing an action from another user like a vote ([Snapshot is a great example](https://snapshot.box/)).

<Card className="flex justify-center">
  <EnsProfile name="nick.eth" />
</Card>

An example of write operations where it's appropriate to show an ENS name is when a user is inputting an address of any kind (token transfer, smart contract interaction, etc.).

<Card>
  <SendTransactionDemo />
</Card>

<div id="send_transaction" />

Beyond these use cases, remember that the [ENS Public Resolver](/resolvers/public) allows you to link [different kinds of resources](/web/records) to ENS names.

## 1. Replacing Ethereum addresses with ENS Names

:::note
An ENS name should only be shown in place of an Ethereum address if the user has set a reverse record for their address, and if the reverse record matches the forward resolution. [Learn more about primary names](/web/reverse).
:::

### 1.1 - Displaying ENS names instead of Ethereum addresses

{/* TODO: build a sample UI of ENS names in a list, like votes or messages or transfers */}

When replacing Ethereum addresses with ENS names you should consider these facts and best practices:

- **Design a truncated version of the ENS name:** ENS names can be very long; besides not being character-limited, users can create an infinite number of nested subdomains.
  If you do show a truncated version of the name, you should provide a way to view the full name, such as expanding it on hover.
- **Not all ENS names end with .eth**: ENS supports [.eth](/registry/eth) and most DNS TLDs such as [.com, .xyz, and 1200+ others](/dns/tlds).
  A correct implementation of ENS treats any dot-separated name as a potential ENS name and will attempt a look-up.

### 1.2 - Always provide an option to see the Ethereum address associated with the ENS name

If you are showing the ENS name in its entirety or a truncated version, you should:

- **Always provide the user a way to display the full Ethereum address**: Notice how if you type "ens.eth" in the [example above](#send_transaction), the resolved ETH address appears under the name.
  This is especially important in high-risk situations, such as when the user is about to send a transaction or interact with a smart contract.
- **Allow the user to copy the full Ethereum address**: Allow the user to copy the full address either through a copy button or by selecting it.
- **Optionally give the user a way to automatically open the Ethereum address in a block explorer** such as Etherscan.
- **Optionally show the** **balance amount of signed-in users.** User research shows that users tend to recognise their own Ethereum address through their balance, as well as the address itself.
  This is meant only for the currently "signed in" user: only show their own balance and avoid showing the balance of other users.

## 2. Resolving input fields

{/* <LiveDemo id="send_transaction" /> */}

Input fields where a user is supposed to insert Ethereum addresses should also accept and resolve ENS names. These inputs indicate that the user wants to interact with another user's Ethereum address or contract.

Follow these guidelines to create the best experience:

- **Wait before resolving the ENS name**: Debounce input fields that accept ENS names to avoid unnecessary network calls. You can also wait for the user to type a minimum of 1 character on both sides of the dot before resolving the name. For example, if the user type "ens.", there is no chance of it being a valid ENS name and therefore no need to resolve it. But after the user types "ens.e", it should be treated as a potential ENS name.
- **Don't overwrite the input field with the Ethereum address:** Show the resolved ENS name near the input field instead.
- **Always display both the ENS name** _**and**_ **the Ethereum address together** : Do this after it has successfully been resolved.

## Other guidelines and tips

### Usernames for accounts that don't have an ENS name

You can offer free ENS names to your users which would not only improve their experience in your application, but also across the Ethereum ecosystem.
See [how to issue subdomains](/web/subdomains).

### Caching and updating ENS Names

If your application needs to display many ENS Names in the UI, you can consider **caching** (for a short period of time) the ENS Name after it has been resolved or after the user has added the name in an input field.

Your **optimistic UI** can display the names from cache **in non-risky situations**, in which your user for example is simply browsing, but doesn't need to act or make decisions based on the information displayed.
However, **in all risky situations** \(eg transferring anything of value or interacting with a smart contract\), you should **perform a direct live resolution** and get the most up to date information from the ENS Registry.

Also consider that users can change their information at any time which may not be tracked in the onchain registry, so you should **periodically validate the information you cached**. [Learn more about offchain ENS names](/learn/ccip-read).

### Notes on displaying Ethereum Addresses (with or without ENS names)

Even when ENS names are not available, [research](https://medium.com/@lyricalpolymath/web3designdecisionframework-e84075816515) [shows](https://medium.com/@lyricalpolymath/web3-design-principles-f21db2f240c1) that there are some good practices to follow when displaying Ethereum addresses in dApps.

- **Always show the initial ' 0x '** to indicate it's an address.
- When displaying the name in shorthand versions, **show the first 5 and last 4 characters of the address**.
  This is not a security requirement as vanity addresses can be spoofed relatively simply; this is a good practice because some users check the beginning of the name and others check the end of the name.
  Also, four is the highest number of elements that our mind can easily chunk, parse and remember well.
- **Always provide a way to display the full Ethereum address.**

## Front-end tools

[Thorin](https://thorin.ens.domains/) is a react component library for the ENS design system.
It provides a set of components that make it easier to follow the guidelines and best practices described above.

# Address Lookup [Learn how to resolve blockchain addresses from human-readable names with ENS.]

The ENS Protocol aims to make it easy to use Ethereum.
It does this by providing a simple way to use human-readable names instead of long machine-readable addresses.

## Getting the users Ethereum Address

The goal here is to take a name, such as `nick.eth`, and convert it to an address, such as `0x225f137127d9067788314bc7fcc1f36746a3c3B5`.

<Card className="flex justify-center">
  <EnsProfile name="nick.eth" />
</Card>

The simplest thing you can do is start with a name, and resolve it to an address.
We call this a "forward lookup".
Think of places where users can enter names, such as sending transactions, chatting, etc.

Note that all dot-separated strings should be treated as potential ENS names, since ENS supports [many TLDs](/dns/tlds). A common mistake is to only treat strings that end in `.eth` as ENS names.

To learn what happens under the hood when you do a forward lookup, read the [resolution](/resolution) section.

## Multi-Chain Addresses (BTC, LTC, etc)

ENS Names aren't just limited to storing Ethereum addresses.
Any blockchain address (BTC, LTC, SOL, etc.) can be queried by [SLIP-0044](https://github.com/satoshilabs/slips/blob/master/slip-0044.md) coin type or a value derived from an EVM Chain ID (specified in [ENSIP-11](/ensip/11)). This includes Ethereum L2 networks such as OP Mainnet and Base.

For EVM Chains besides Mainnet Ethereum, always use its [ENSIP-11](/ensip/11) coin type, irrespective of being included in SLIP-0044 (like Ether Classic).

The standardization of multichain addresses was first introduced in [ENSIP-9](/ensip/9), and also [EIP-2304](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2304).

:::note
Regardless of the chain you're resolving an address for, ENS resolution always starts from Ethereum L1.

### Decoding Address Hashes

ENS resolvers store all addresses in bytes, which may have to be encoded to their respective address formats. To do this, we recommend using the [@ensdomains/address-encoder](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ensdomains/address-encoder) package.

# Subgraph

This is a page covering the graph's ENS subgraph. The ENS subgraph indexes on-chain events of second-level .eth names, and DNS imported names.
It allows us to build a reasonable approximation of the ENS names an address owns.

To read more about why not all names (such as Offchain & Gasless Names) show up in the subgraph read the [listing names](/web/enumerate) page.

## The Graph

The Graph is a protocol for indexing and querying data from blockchains. There are multiple subgraphs that you can use to query information about ENS names.
These subgraphs are available for [mainnet](https://api.thegraph.com/subgraphs/name/ensdomains/ens), [sepolia](https://api.studio.thegraph.com/query/49574/enssepolia/version/latest) and [holesky](https://api.studio.thegraph.com/query/49574/ensholesky/version/latest).

:::note
Developers are welcome to use our rate limited API endpoints above for
testing, but it is highly encouraged to [sign up for a free account with
TheGraph](https://thegraph.com/studio/apikeys/) to get your own API key.
:::

## GraphQL Schema

The schema for the ENS subgraph is defined in [/schema.graphql](https://github.com/ensdomains/ens-subgraph/blob/master/schema.graphql).

## Use Cases

There are certain use cases where the graph is better for querying ENS specific information than through the resolution process.
One of such use-cases is querying which NFT names are owned by a specific address.

## Example Queries

One can explore the following examples interactively via the [Graph Explorer Playground](https://thegraph.com/explorer/subgraphs/5XqPmWe6gjyrJtFn9cLy237i4cWw2j9HcUJEXsP5qGtH?view=Playground&chain=arbitrum-one)

### Getting a list of names owned by an account

Ensure the address is lowercase

```graphql
query getDomainsForAccount {
  domains(where: { owner: "0xa508c16666c5b8981fa46eb32784fccc01942a71" }) {
    name
  }
}
```

### Getting the top domain for an account based on the longest registry

```graphql
query getDomainForAccount {
  account(id: "0xa508c16666c5b8981fa46eb32784fccc01942a71") {
    registrations(first: 1, orderBy: expiryDate, orderDirection: desc) {
      domain {
        name
      }
    }
    id
  }
}
```

returns

```json
{
  "data": {
    "account": {
      "registrations": [
        {
          "domain": {
            "name": "datanexus.eth"
          }
        }
      ],
      "id": "0xa508c16666c5b8981fa46eb32784fccc01942a71"
    }
  }
}
```

### Searching for a subdomain

```graphql
query getSubDomains($Account: String = "messari.eth") {
  domains(where: { name: "messari.eth" }) {
    name
    id
    subdomains(first: 10) {
      name
    }
    subdomainCount
  }
}
```

returns

```json
{
  "data": {
    "domains": [
      {
        "name": "messari.eth",
        "id": "0x498ada62251a1227664ace8d97b0de2dcc6652ddf61e6fb5d3150f43ccf599e6",
        "subdomains": [
          {
            "name": "subgraphs.messari.eth"
          },
          {
            "name": "bd.messari.eth"
          }
        ],
        "subdomainCount": 2
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Getting the expiry of an ENS domain

```graphql
query getDomainExp($Account: String = "paulieb.eth") {
  registrations(
    where: { domain_: { name: $Account } }
    first: 1
    orderBy: expiryDate
    orderDirection: desc
  ) {
    expiryDate
  }
}
```

returns

```json
{
  "data": {
    "registrations": [
      {
        "expiryDate": "1714752524"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

# Text Records

With every name come a set of records. These records are key value pairs that can be used to store information about the profile.
Think of this as a user's **digital backpack**. Utalized for storage of preferences, public details, and more.

<Card>
  <TextRecords name="nick.eth" keys={['description', 'com.twitter']} />
</Card>

Text records allow us to attach and read any key value pair from an ENS name. The most popular records have been standardised.
One example of a standardised record is the [avatar record](/web/avatars) which is used to store a user's profile picture.

## Getting Records

To fetch the record for a specific name, you can use one of the following methods:

:::code-group

```tsx [Wagmi]
// https://wagmi.sh/react/api/hooks/useEnsText
import { normalize } from 'viem/ens'
import { useEnsText } from 'wagmi'

export const MyProfile: FC<{ name: string }> = ({ name }) => {
  const { data } = useEnsText({
    name: normalize('luc.eth'),
    key: 'com.twitter',
  })

  return (
    <div>
      <span>Twitter: {data}</span>
    </div>
  )
}
```

```tsx [Ethers]
// https://docs.ethers.org/v5/api/providers/provider/#EnsResolver
const provider = new ethers.providers.JsonRpcProvider()

const resolver = await provider.getResolver('luc.eth')
const twitter = await resolver.getText('com.twitter')
```

```tsx [Viem]
// https://viem.sh/docs/ens/actions/getEnsText.html
import { createPublicClient, http } from 'viem'
import { mainnet } from 'viem/chains'
import { normalize } from 'viem/ens'

const publicClient = createPublicClient({
  chain: mainnet,
  transport: http(),
})

const ensText = await publicClient.getEnsText({
  name: normalize('luc.eth'),
  key: 'com.twitter',
})
```

```python [web3.py]
# https://web3py.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ens_overview.html#text-records
from ens.auto import ns

# set text
ns.set_text('alice.eth', 'url', 'https://example.com')

# get text
url = ns.get_text('alice.eth', 'url')
assert url == 'https://example.com'
```

```go [Go]
package main

import (
	"fmt"

	"github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/ethclient"
	ens "github.com/wealdtech/go-ens/v3"
)

func main() {
	client, _ := ethclient.Dial("https://rpc.ankr.com/eth")

	domain, _ := ens.Normalize("luc.eth")
	resolver, _ := ens.NewResolver(client, domain)
	twitter, _ := resolver.Text("com.twitter")

	fmt.Println("Twitter: ", twitter)
}
```

## Types of Records

Here are some of the most commonly used records:

| Name        | Usage                                        | Reference             | Example             |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------- | --------------------- | ------------------- |
| display     | Preferred capitalization                     | [ENSIP-5](/ensip/5)   | Luc.eth             |
| avatar      | Avatar or logo (see [Avatars](/web/avatars)) | [ENSIP-5](/ensip/5)   | ipfs://dQw4w9WgXcQ  |
| description | Description of the name                      | [ENSIP-5](/ensip/5)   | DevRel @ ENS Labs   |
| keywords    | List of comma-separated keywords             | [ENSIP-5](/ensip/5)   | person, ens         |
| email       | Email address                                | [ENSIP-5](/ensip/5)   | luc@ens.domains     |
| mail        | Physical mailing address                     | [ENSIP-5](/ensip/5)   | V3X HQ              |
| notice      | Notice regarding this name                   | [ENSIP-5](/ensip/5)   | This is a notice    |
| location    | Generic location (e.g. "Toronto, Canada")    | [ENSIP-5](/ensip/5)   | Breda, NL           |
| phone       | Phone number as an E.164 string              | [ENSIP-5](/ensip/5)   | +1 234 567 890      |
| url         | Website URL                                  | [ENSIP-5](/ensip/5)   | https://ens.domains |
| header      | Image URL to be used as a header/banner      | [ENSIP-18](/ensip/18) | ipfs://dQw4w9WgXcQ  |

### Other Records

Currently there are a few records that have been standardised. However you are welcome to store any key value pair you desire.
We generally recommend to stick to a pattern, or prefix things with your app or protocol (eg. `com.discord`, or `org.reddit`), as such to avoid collisions.

One of the newer standardised records is the "header" record. This header record, similar to the avatar record, accepts any IPFS, Arweave, EIP155, or regular URL to an image resource.
The image is then displayed as a banner on the profile page and tends to be in a 1:3 aspect ratio.

## Setting Records

When records are loaded they are loaded from the resolver responsible for the name. As resolvers are user controlled, we cannot guarantee a write function is available.
This makes it a more in-depth process to update a users records.

# Multichain [L2 & Crosschain Resolution]

## ENS L2

The ENS Labs team recently announced our plans and roadmap for scaling ENS to the entire internet and beyond. You can read more [on our blog](https://blog.ens.domains/post/ensv2), [on X](https://twitter.com/ensdomains/status/1795440186513576318), and [the forums](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/technical-feedback-thread-for-ensv2/19233).

The roadmap involves migrating .eth registrations to a new system, in addition to improved support for existing L2 solutions.
You can find out more on the [changelog](/changelog).

## But isn't ENS on mainnet?

Yes, technically. The resolution process always starts on mainnet. There needs to be, one source of truth after all. However, the name
resolution process can branch off to other chains, offchain gateways and much more.

To read a more in-depth explanation of how resolution works, checkout the [section dedicated to the Resolution Process](/resolution/).

## My dapp is on X but I want ENS

The ENS Protocol can be used on/for any chain!
If you are building a non-mainnet dApp and want to use ENS names simply [add a Mainnet RPC to your Wagmi config](/web/libraries) and specify `chainId: 1` in your config like so:

```tsx
import { useAccount, useEnsAvatar, useEnsName } from 'wagmi'

const Name = () => {
  const { data: ensName } = useEnsAddress({
    address: 'luc.eth',
    chainId: 1, // (1 = Ethereum, 11155111 = Sepolia) // [!code hl]
  })

  return <div>{ensName || address}</div>
}
```

And voila! You can now resolve ENS names anywhere! 🎉

# Resolution

The process by which we load information about a name is called resolution. It's a simple process, but it's important to understand.
Here is a diagram of some of the contracts involved when resolving a name.

<Card>
  <img
    src="/img/resolution-diagram-1.png"
    alt="Diagram of the ENS resolution process"
  />
</Card>

The resolution process involves multiple parts. Most notably the [Registry](/registry/ens), multiple Registrars ([ETH Registrar](/registry/eth), [DNS Registrar](/registry/dns), [Reverse Registrar](/registry/reverse), etc)
and the concept of a [Resolver](/resolvers/quickstart).

## How to resolve

Here is a little peek at what happens under the hood of your favourite library when you do a name lookup.

### 1. Find the Resolver

Every name has a "resolver". A resolver is simply a contract that implements the [resolver specification](/resolvers/quickstart) and can be queried for information about a name.
To get the resolver responsible for a name, you can query [The Registry](/registry/ens) for the `resolver` of a name.

:::code-group

```solidity [Solidity]
ENS.resolver(bytes32 node) view returns (address)
```

```tsx [Wagmi]
// https://wagmi.sh/react/api/hooks/useEnsResolver
import { normalize } from 'viem/ens'
import { useEnsResolver } from 'wagmi'

export const MyResolver = () => {
  const { data: myResolver } = useEnsResolver({
    name: normalize('luc.eth'), // The name to lookup
  })

  return <div>{myResolver}</div>
}
```

```ts [Ethers]
const resolver = await provider.getResolver('luc.eth')
```

```ts [viem]
// https://viem.sh/docs/ens/actions/getEnsResolver.html
import { normalize } from 'viem/ens'

import { publicClient } from './client'

const ensResolver = await publicClient.getEnsResolver({
  name: normalize('luc.eth'),
})
```

```py [Web3.py]
# https://web3py.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ens_overview.html#working-with-resolvers
from ens.auto import ns

resolver = ns.resolver('alice.eth')
```

:::

To verify which specifications are implemented by a resolver, you can call the `supportsInterface(bytes4 interfaceID)` on the resolver with the interfaceID you would like to test for.

### 2. Query the Resolver

Now you have found the resolver responsible for the name in question, you can query it for the information you are interested in.
There are many ways you can query the resolver, `addr()` `text()` `contenthash()` `abi()` etc.

If the resolver supports text records, you can call `text()` to get that text record for the name.
More about loading information from a resolver can be found [here](/resolvers/interacting).

#### Wildcard Resolution

In addition, all of the above functions can be sent to the `resolve()` function, specified in [ENSIP-10](/ensip/10).
This allows for not only multicall functionality, but also easier implementation of EIP-3668, and more.
Most clients & many resolvers utilize wildcard resolution as their primary form of resolution.

## Reverse Resolution

Due to the modular nature of how ENS is designed, it is also possible to lookup the "primary name" of an address.
This process actually uses forward resolution under the hood, you read that right - its just forwards resolution.

To look up the primary name of a given address, you must do a resolver lookup for `addr.reverse` and then query the `name()` field on the resolver.
This name field returns the "preferred" name for the address. You should always follow up a reverse lookup with a forward lookup to verify that the resulting name points back to the original address. If the address doesn't match, display the address rather than the reversed name.

```solidity
/// @dev The starting point for all ENS resolution is the Registry
ENS ens = 0x00000000000C2E074eC69A0dFb2997BA6C7d2e1e;

/// @dev The node hash for "addr.reverse"
bytes32 ADDR_REVERSE_NODE = 0x91d1777781884d03a6757a803996e38de2a42967fb37eeaca72729271025a9e2;

/// @dev Returns the node hash for a given account's reverse records, `{address}.addr.reverse`
function reverseNode(address addr) public pure returns (bytes32) {
  return keccak256(
      abi.encodePacked(ADDR_REVERSE_NODE, sha3HexAddress(addr))
    );
}

/// @dev Get the reverse record for an address
function getReverseRecord(address addr) public view returns (string) {
    bytes32 reverseNodeHash = reverseNode(addr);

    // Get the resolver for the reverse node
    Resolver resolver = ens.resolver(reverseNodeHash);

    // Get the address's preferred name
    return resolver.name(reverseNodeHash);
}
```

:::info
**Important**: The client MUST perform a forward resolution on a user's reverse record to verify the address matches the one you are looking up. The example above does not perform this verification.
:::

Please note that many libraries already have functionality to do this. You can read more about it in the [Getting a Primary Name](/web/reverse) section.

import { NameProcessing } from '../../components/NameProcessing'
import { Card } from '../../components/ui/Card'

# Name Processing [Normalization and recommendations for how to handle names]

When interacting with the ENS smart contracts directly, it is important to note that names are not stored as strings. [Libraries](/web/libraries) handle name encoding for you when implementing basic name resolution, but you may need to handle the encoding yourself when interacting with the protocol directly.

Below is an interactive tool that shows all the different formats of names and how to implement them.

<Card>
  <NameProcessing />
</Card>

## Name Normalization

Normalization is the process of canonicalizing a name before running it through the [Namehash](#namehash) algorithm. It is important to always normalize all input, because even one little difference (like a capital vs lowercase character) will cause the namehash to be completely different.

For example, `NaMe.EtH` normalizes to `name.eth`. This ensures that the correct Registry node is used, no matter how the user types in the name.

ENS names are validated and normalized using the [ENSIP-15](/ensip/15) normalization algorithm.

Previously, [UTS-46](https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr46/) was used, but that is insufficient for emoji sequences. Correct emoji processing is only possible with [UTS-51](https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr51/). The [ENSIP-15](/ensip/15) normalization algorithm draws from those older Unicode standards, but also adds many other validation rules to prevent common spoofing techniques like inserting zero-width characters, or using confusable (look-alike) characters. See here for additional discussion on this: [Homogylphs](https://support.ens.domains/en/articles/7901658-homoglyphs)

A standard implementation of the algorithm is available at [@adraffy/ens-normalize](https://github.com/adraffy/ens-normalize.js). This library is used under the hood in [viem](https://viem.sh/docs/ens/utilities/normalize), [ENSjs](https://github.com/ensdomains/ensjs/blob/main/packages/ensjs/src/utils/normalise.ts#L27), and others.

```js
import { normalize } from 'viem/ens'

// Uses @adraffy/ens-normalize under the hood

const normalized = normalize('RaFFY🚴‍♂️.eTh')
// => "raffy🚴‍♂.eth"
```

If the name was not able to be normalized, then that method will throw an error. A name is valid if it is able to be normalized.

## Namehash

:::note
You **MUST** [normalize](#normalize) a name before you attempt to create a namehash! If you don't, then the hash you get may be incorrect. Some libraries like [ensjs](https://github.com/ensdomains/ensjs) will automatically do this for you.
:::

In the core ENS registry, names are stored as a hash instead of the raw string to optimize for gas, performance, and more. This hashed value is typically referred to as a `node`. The node is a hex-encoded 32-byte value that is derived from the name using the `namehash` algorithm defined in [ENSIP-1](/ensip/1).

Namehash is a recursive algorithm that hashes each part of the name, then hashes the results together. Because recursive functions aren't very efficient in Solidity, it's usually best to derive the namehash offchain and pass to it a contract. Luckily, there are libraries that do this for us.

:::code-group

```tsx [Viem]
// https://viem.sh/docs/ens/utilities/namehash
import { namehash, normalize } from 'viem/ens'

const normalizedName = normalize('name.eth')
const node = namehash(normalizedName)
```

```ts [Ethers.js]
// https://docs.ethers.org/v6/api/hashing/#namehash
import { ensNormalize, namehash } from 'ethers/hash'

const normalizedName = ensNormalize('name.eth')
const node = namehash(normalizedName)
```

```python [ens-namehash-py]
# https://github.com/ConsenSysMesh/ens-namehash-py
from namehash import namehash

node = namehash('name.eth')
```

```rust [namehash-rust]
// https://github.com/InstateDev/namehash-rust
fn main() {
  let node = &namehash("name.eth");
  let s = hex::encode(&node);
}
```

```solidity [Solidity]
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.20;

import "@ensdomains/ens-contracts/contracts/utils/NameEncoder.sol";

contract MyContract {
    function namehash(string calldata name) public pure returns (bytes32) {
        (, bytes32 node) = NameEncoder.dnsEncodeName(name);
        return node;
    }
}
```

:::

### Algorithm

The specification for the namehash algorithm was originally defined in [EIP-137](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-137#namehash-algorithm) (same as [ENSIP-1](/ensip/1)).

It's a recursive algorithm that works its way down until you hit the root domain. For `ens.eth`, the algorithm works like so:

```
namehash('ens.eth') = keccak256(namehash('eth') + labelhash('ens'))
namehash('eth') = keccak256(namehash('') + labelhash('eth'))
namehash('') = 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
```

That last line is a special case: The namehash for an empty string (representing the root domain) is 32 null bytes.

If you plug everything in above, you'll end up with the final namehash value:

```
namehash('') = 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

labelhash('eth') = keccak256('eth') = 0x4f5b812789fc606be1b3b16908db13fc7a9adf7ca72641f84d75b47069d3d7f0

namehash('eth') = keccak256(namehash('') + labelhash('eth')) = keccak256(0x00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000004f5b812789fc606be1b3b16908db13fc7a9adf7ca72641f84d75b47069d3d7f0) = 0x93cdeb708b7545dc668eb9280176169d1c33cfd8ed6f04690a0bcc88a93fc4ae

labelhash('ens') = keccak256('ens') = 0x5cee339e13375638553bdf5a6e36ba80fb9f6a4f0783680884d92b558aa471da

namehash('ens.eth') = keccak256(namehash('eth') + labelhash('ens')) = keccak256(0x93cdeb708b7545dc668eb9280176169d1c33cfd8ed6f04690a0bcc88a93fc4ae5cee339e13375638553bdf5a6e36ba80fb9f6a4f0783680884d92b558aa471da) = 0x4e34d3a81dc3a20f71bbdf2160492ddaa17ee7e5523757d47153379c13cb46df

```

This brings us to the final node for ens.eth: `0x4e34d3a81dc3a20f71bbdf2160492ddaa17ee7e5523757d47153379c13cb46df`

### Reverse Nodes

The [Reverse Node](/terminology#reverse-node) is a node in the Registry that can be claimed for any Ethereum account. The name this node represents is `[addr].addr.reverse`, where `[addr]` is the Ethereum public address (lowercase, without the "0x"). These reverse nodes are typically used to set a [Primary Name](#primary-name) for an account.

To generate the namehash for a reverse node:

- Take the input address and:
  - Remove the "0x" at the beginning
  - Convert all characters to lowercase
- Add `.addr.reverse` to the end
- Run this result through the namehash algorithm

For example, for address `0x481f50a5BdcCC0bc4322C4dca04301433dED50f0`, the name for the reverse node is:

- `481f50a5bdccc0bc4322c4dca04301433ded50f0.addr.reverse`

And the resulting namehash for the reverse node is:

- `0x58354ffdde6ac279f3a058aafbeeb14059bcb323a248fb338ee41f95fa544c86`

You **MUST** [normalize](#normalize) a name before you attempt to create a labelhash! If you don't, then the hash you get may be incorrect.
:::

Labelhash is the Keccak-256 hash of a single label (e.g. `name` in `name.eth`), used in places that don't require the full name.

One example of where labelhash is used is in the [BaseRegistar](/registry/eth), since it only supports registering 2LDs (second-level domains, like `name.eth`) and not 3LDs+ (e.g. `sub.name.eth`). The token ID of a second-level .eth name in the BaseRegistar is the uint256 of the labelhash.

:::code-group

```tsx [Viem]
// https://viem.sh/docs/ens/utilities/labelhash
import { labelhash, normalize } from 'viem/ens'

const normalizedLabel = normalize('label')
const hash = labelhash(normalizedLabel)
```

```tsx [Ethers]
// https://docs.ethers.org/v6/api/crypto/#keccak256
import { keccak256 } from 'ethers/crypto'
import { ensNormalize } from 'ethers/hash'
import { toUtf8Bytes } from 'ethers/utils'

const normalizedLabel = ensNormalize('label')
const labelhash = keccak256(toUtf8Bytes(normalizedLabel))
```

```solidity [Solidity]
string constant label = "label";
bytes32 constant labelhash = keccak256(bytes(label));
```

:::

## DNS Encoding

:::note
You **MUST** [normalize](#normalize) a name before you DNS-encode it! If you
don't, then when you pass those DNS-encoded bytes into a contract method,
incorrect namehashes/labelhashes may be derived.
:::

This is a binary format for domain names, which encodes the length of each label along with the label itself. It is used by some of the ENS contracts, such as when wrapping names in the [Name Wrapper](/wrapper/overview) or resolving data with [ENSIP-10](/ensip/10).

:::code-group

```tsx [Viem]
import { packetToBytes } from 'viem/ens'
import { toHex } from 'viem/utils'

const name = 'name.eth'
const dnsEncodedName = toHex(packetToBytes(name))
// 0x046e616d650365746800
```

```tsx [Ethers]
// https://docs.ethers.org/v6/api/hashing/#dnsEncode
import { dnsEncode } from 'ethers/lib/utils'

const dnsEncodedName = dnsEncode('name.eth')
```

```solidity [Solidity]
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.20;

import "@ensdomains/ens-contracts/contracts/utils/NameEncoder.sol";

contract MyContract {
    function dnsEncode(string calldata name) public pure returns (bytes memory) {
        (bytes memory dnsEncodedName,) = NameEncoder.dnsEncodeName(name);
        return dnsEncodedName;
    }
}
```

:::

### Decoding

To decode a DNS-encoded name, you can use `bytesToPacket()` from ENSjs.

```tsx
import { bytesToPacket } from '@ensdomains/ensjs/utils'
import { hexToBytes } from 'viem/utils'

const dnsEncodedName = '0x046e616d650365746800'
const name = bytesToPacket(hexToBytes(dnsEncodedName))
// name.eth
```

### Algorithm

To DNS-encode a name, first split the name into labels (delimited by `.`). Then for each label from left-to-right:

- One byte to denote the length of the label
- The UTF-8 encoded bytes for the label
- If this is the last label, then one final NUL (`0x00`) byte.

For example, to DNS-encode `my.name.eth`:

- `0x02` (length of the label "my")
- `0x6D79` (UTF-8 encoded bytes of "my")
- `0x04` (length of the label "name")
- `0x6E616D65` (UTF-8 encoded bytes of "name")
- `0x03` (length of the label "eth")
- `0x657468` (UTF-8 encoded bytes of "eth")
- `0x00` (end of name marker)

Final result: `0x026d79046e616d650365746800`

:::note
Since the length of each label is stored in a single byte, that means that with this DNS-encoding scheme, each label is limited to being 255 UTF-8 encoded bytes in length. Because of this, names with longer labels cannot be wrapped in the [Name Wrapper](/wrapper/overview), as that contract uses the DNS-encoded name.

# DNS on ENS [ENS supports DNS names, allowing users to import DNS names into ENS.]

The Ethereum Name Service is so much more than just `.eth` names. It is a general-purpose naming system that can be used for any kind of name. This includes DNS names.
DNS functionality was originally introduced in [ENSIP-6](/ensip/6).

## Importing a DNS name

There are currently two ways of importing a DNS name into ENS. Both methods require you enable DNSSEC on your domain, and setup a TXT record.
This record is then verified using smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain.

To import a name, simply visit the [ENS Manager](https://ens.app), type in your name, and click "Import DNS". You will walked through setting up your DNS records.
Additionally you can read more about the records and specifications here:

<EmbedLink
  title="Importing a DNS name Gaslessly"
  href="/registry/dns#gasless-import"
/>

## Why DNS on ENS?

ENS aims to extend the existing functionality of the DNS system. This also means that existing DNS names (such as `.com`, `.org`, or `.xyz`) should be able to leverage the benefits of the ENS resolution process.

<DNSGrid />

## DNS Names in the wild

DNS names are widely used and many users may already have one without even realizing it. Some major platforms that issue subdomains of their DNS names include:

<DNSUsageExamples />

## Top-Level Domains

In addition to allowing any DNSSEC enabled name to be imported, ENS also allows existing DNS TLDs to take control of their smart-contract resolution process.
Resulting in even more seamless integration with the DNS system.

A list of all supported TLDs can be found [here](/dns/tlds)

# What is the Ethereum Name Service?

The Ethereum Name Service (ENS) is a distributed, open, and extensible naming system based on the Ethereum blockchain.

<Card className="flex flex-col items-center justify-center gap-2 sm:flex-row">
  <EnsProfile name="nick.eth" />
  <EnsProfile name="jefflau.eth" />
</Card>

ENS maps human-readable names like 'alice.eth' to machine-readable identifiers such as Ethereum addresses, other cryptocurrency addresses, content hashes, metadata, and more.
ENS also supports 'reverse resolution', making it possible to associate metadata such as primary names or interface descriptions with Ethereum addresses.

Top-Level Domains (TLDs), like `.eth` and `.test`, are owned by smart contracts called [registrars](/registry/eth), which specify rules governing the allocation of their names.
Enabling seamless interoperability with the DNS (Domain Name System).

## ETH Registrar

The [ETH Registrar](/registry/eth) is the registrar for the `.eth` TLD, it allows for trustless decentralized names to be issued as tokens on the Ethereum Blockchain.
Registration is done through smart contracts, and name ownership is secured by the Ethereum blockchain.

## DNS + ENS

ENS has similar goals to DNS, the existing Internet's Domain Name Service, and aims to extend its capability.
ENS also supports importing DNS names through the use of DNSSEC.
Allowing you to take your `.com`, `.xyz`, or `.art` (and more) into the ENS ecosystem. Read more about DNSSEC names [on this page](/learn/dns).

<DNSGrid />

## Subnames

<Card className="flex items-center justify-center text-xl">
  <div className="text-right font-bold">
    {['root', 'registrar', 'controller', 'resolver', 'registry'].map(
      (subname, i) => (
        <div
          className={
            ['opacity-20', 'opacity-50', '', 'opacity-50', 'opacity-20'][i]
          }
          key={subname}
        >
          {subname}
        </div>
      )
    )}
  </div>
  <div className="text-blue font-bold">.ens.eth</div>
</Card>

Because of the hierarchical nature of ENS, anyone who owns a domain at any level can take control of resolution.
Users can create subdomains manually, or take matters into their own hands and write their own resolution logic.

For instance, if Alice owns 'alice.eth', she can create 'pay.alice.eth' and configure it as she wishes.
Or, use a [Custom Resolver](/resolvers/quickstart), and programmatically issue subdomains, for example in an App, Community, or DAO.

# Resolution [The ENS Resolution Process]

:::note
This document aims to provide a brief overview of how resolution works, to
read more about resolution checkout the [dedicated Resolution
Section](/resolution).
:::

One of the major parts of the ENS protocol is the resolution process. The Resolution process at its core is the process of converting a human-readable name to a machine-readable address.

Though there is a lot of smart contract magic under the hood, the ENS system consists of two main paths: [Forward Resolution](#forward-resolution), used to go from name to address (and load other extra data), and [Reverse Resolution](#reverse-resolution), used to go from address to name.

## Forward Resolution

Forwards resolution is the process of going **from name to address**. As well as to load the records associated to a name.
These records include but are not limited to **discord**, **twitter**, **github**, **email**, **timezone**, and more.

{/* TODO: Turn this into a component and fetch live data */}

Implementing forwards resolution in a dApp can be as simple as using a single line of code!
To learn more about how to implement forwards resolution, check out the [Address Resolution](/web/resolution) documentation.

## Reverse Resolution

Reverse resolution is the process of going **from address to name**. This is a crucial part of the ENS system, as it allows for any address, to be resolved into a human readable name.
Instead of pages filled with addresses, you can now show the names of the people behind the addresses.

<Card className="flex items-center justify-center gap-2">
  <span className="font-medium">0x225...c3B5</span>

# Deployments

:::note
This page contains information that is only relevant to developers who would
like to interact with the contract manually. Most libraries will handle this
for you.
:::

ENS is multichain (read more [here](/web/multichain)) and can be used in any application.
In addition to being able to query many address formats and record types, data can be stored [practically anywhere](/learn/ccip-read).
However, resolution needs to start somewhere, so the entrypoint for resolution is Ethereum Mainnet, alongside the most popular testnets.

# Layer 2 & Offchain Resolution

All ENS resolution starts on Ethereum Mainnet (or testnet).
However, by leveraging [CCIP Read](/resolvers/ccip-read) and [Wildcard Resolution](/ensip/10), name resolution can be taken cross-chain, off-chain, and more.
This allows for a lot of flexibility in how you can use your ENS and for storage of your ENS records on your favourite Layer 2, or even off-chain.

## ENS on Layer 2

In the resolution process, clients first fetch the resolver associated with the name in the ENS registry on L1. That resolver is responsible for telling the client where to find the data associated with the name such as the addresses, text records, etc.

If you want to register and resolve (sub)names from L2, you would write a resolver smart contract that defers resolution to the L2 and ideally verifies that data against the L2's storage proofs posted to L1. This process can be done with the [Unruggable Gateway](https://gateway-docs.unruggable.com/).

An example implementation of Layer 2 resolving is:

### linea.eth

Linea was the first L2 team to build a trust-minimized ENS subname system. Names are stored on Linea, verified with [storage proofs](https://docs.linea.build/developers/tooling/cross-chain/ccip-read-gateway) on L1, and function as ENS subnames such as [greg.linea.eth](https://app.ens.domains/greg.linea.eth). You can try it out [here](https://names.linea.build/).

### clv.eth

Clave is focused on enhancing user experience and security through a mobile wallet that leverages account abstraction and device hardware. Clave accounts come with usernames that are now stored onchain in ZKsync Era, verified with [storage proofs](https://github.com/getclave/zksync-storage-proofs) in L1, and issued as ENS subnames such as [ulas.clv.eth](https://enstate.rs/n/ulas.clv.eth). You can read more about the implementation [here](https://blog.getclave.io/introducing-onchain-clave-usernames-with-ens).

## Primary Names on Layer 2

The process of setting primary names from L2 is under active development. This doc will be updated as more information becomes available.

## Offchain Resolution

Moving resolution processes off-chain offers numerous advantages, including efficiency gains and reduced congestion on the main blockchain; however, it also introduces trade-offs in terms of trust, as it necessitates reliance on external systems.
Depending on the implementation, names could be stored in a database or be ephemeral.
Advantages of offchain name storage include gaslessness and instant updates.
If this sounds appealing consider [writing an Offchain Resolver](/resolvers/ccip-read).

Popular implementations of offchain names include but are not limited to:

### cb.id

Coinbase Wallet is one of the largest mobile wallets issuing free ENS subnames to their users.
These names are stored off-chain on coinbase servers, and can be registered from the Coinbase Wallet App or Browser Extension.
An example of a cb.id is [lucemans.cb.id](https://enstate.rs/n/lucemans.cb.id).

### uni.eth

Uniswap Wallet is another popular mobile wallet that issues free ENS subnames to their users.
You can read more about the Uniswap Wallet ENS integration [here](https://blog.uniswap.org/introducing-uni-eth-your-unique-web3-username).
An example of a uni.eth is [lucemans.uni.eth](https://enstate.rs/n/lucemans.uni.eth).

### lens.xyz

The Lens Ecosystem is also readily accessible through the officially maintained `lens.xyz` gateway.
This means that you can lookup your favourite lens name such as [lucemans.lens.xyz](https://enstate.rs/n/lucemans.lens.xyz) and retrieve the information seamlessly.

# Smart Contracts

The Ethereum Name Service is made up of a set of smart contracts.
These smart contracts are responsible for storing and managing information associated with names.

## Resolution

The resolution process outlines how a name is resolved.
This includes the process of finding a resolver, and then using that resolver to fetch information about a name.

<EmbedLink
  title="Resolution Process"
  description="The resolution process"
  href="/resolution"
/>

## Resolvers

Every name has a resolver, responsible for fetching information about a name, such as address, avatar, and more.
Resolvers allow for programmatic control over the information associated with a name, implemented in solidity.

There are various resolvers to choose from, such as the [Public Resolver](/resolvers/public) or [write your own](/resolvers/writing).
