# Transaction Provider

The Transaction Provider component supplies the necessary context for managing on-chain transactions within the application. It provides state management and utility functions for handling transaction modals, batching, and more.

<Callout type="warning">
  The TransactionProvider must wrap any components that need access to transaction context, including the
  TransactionModal component.
</Callout>

## Add to your project

```tsx copy
import { TransactionProvider } from 'identity-kit/src/context/transactionContext'

export default function App() {
  return <TransactionProvider>{/* Your application components */}</TransactionProvider>
}
```

| `paymasterService`  | The paymaster service to use for sponsored transactions. (string)      | No       | -             |
| `defaultChainId`    | The default chain ID to use for the transaction provider. (number)     | No       | -             |
| `children`          | The child components that will have access to the transaction context. | Yes      | -             |

## Usage

The `TransactionProvider` component is used to wrap parts of your application that require access to transaction-related state and functions. It manages the state of transaction modals, pending transactions, and provides utility functions for transaction operations.

### Features

- **Transaction Modal Management**: Controls the visibility and state of transaction modals.
- **Batch Transactions**: Supports batching of multiple transactions for a streamlined user experience.
- **Default Chain ID**: The default chain ID to use if the user does not have an EFP list yet (Has to mint the new list).
- **Transaction State Management**: Provides state and functions for managing pending transactions, current transaction index, and more.
- **Paymaster Service**: Supports paymaster services for sponsored transactions.

<Callout type="info">
  The provider supports paymaster services for sponsored transactions. See the [Coinbase Paymaster
  documentation](https://docs.cdp.coinbase.com/paymaster/docs/welcome) for more details.
</Callout>

### Batching Transactions

If you set `batchTransactions` to `true`, the `TransactionProvider` will manage a batch of transactions. This will allow you to either execute transactions one by one or batch them together and have a cart-like experience.

```tsx
<TransactionProvider batchTransactions={true}>
  <YourComponent />
</TransactionProvider>
```

You will have to provide a button in your application that will open the transaction modal.

```tsx
import { useTransactions } from 'ethereum-identity-kit'

/* ... your code ... */
const { setTxModalOpen } = useTransactions()

<button onClick={() => setTxModalOpen(true)}>Open Transaction Modal</button>
/* ... your code ... */
```

### Context Values

The `TransactionProvider` supplies the following context values:

- `txModalOpen`: Boolean indicating if the transaction modal is open.
- `batchTransactions`: Boolean indicating if transactions are batched.
- `pendingTxs`: Array of pending transactions.
- `currentTxIndex`: Index of the current transaction being processed.
- `selectedChainId`: ID of the selected blockchain network.
- `addTransactions`: Function to add new transactions.
- `resetTransactions`: Function to reset all transactions.
- `goToNextTransaction`: Function to proceed to the next transaction.
- `lists`: The EFP lists of the connected user.
- `listsLoading`: Boolean indicating if the EFP lists of the connected user are loading.

### Notes

<Callout type="warning">
  Ensure that the `TransactionProvider` wraps components that need access to transaction context.
</Callout>

<Callout type="info">
  The `batchTransactions` parameter determines if transactions should be batched. When enabled, it provides a cart-like
  experience for managing multiple transactions.
